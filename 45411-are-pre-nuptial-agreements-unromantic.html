But what does the British public make of them?</p><p>Britons are more likely to see pre-nuptial agreements as a good idea (42%) than a bad one (13%). Another 25% see them as neither good nor bad, with the remaining 20% unsure.</p><p>Given that pre-nuptial agreements are most stereotypically associated with wealthy men trying to prevent their wives from taking a substantial portion of their fortune upon divorce, it is perhaps surprising to see that women are noticeably more likely to see pre-nups as a good idea (47%) than men (38%).</p><p>Younger Britons are also more likely to see them as an actively good idea than their elders: 46-47% of the under-50 age groups say so, compared to 37% aged 65 and above. Older Britons are more likely to see them in neutral terms (29% of the over-50 age groups say they are neither good nor bad) than younger Britons.</p><h3>How many Britons would prefer to get a pre-nuptial agreement?</h3><p>Despite 42% of Britons seeing pre-nups as a good idea, only around half as many (22%) say that if they were getting married for the first time now they would prefer to have a pre-nuptial agreement.</p><p>By contrast, four in ten (42%) say they would prefer not to get a pre-nup – a further 22% are unsure and 14% say they never want to get married in the first place.</p><p>Younger people are more willing to say they would prefer a pre-nup than their elders, mirroring their increased belief that they are a good idea. Yet despite women being more likely to see them as a good idea than men, there is not a gender divide at the top line, with 22% of men and 23% of women saying they would prefer one.</p><p>However, when you break the gender results down by income, a pattern emerges. Women become somewhat more likely to say they would prefer a pre-nuptial agreement the more money they earn: while 20% of women earning under £20,000 a year say they would prefer to get a pre-nuptial agreement, this rises to 32% of those earning £60,000 a year or more.</p><p>By contrast, the most money a man earns the more likely they are to say they would prefer not to have a pre-nup. While 37% of men earning less than £20,000 a year say they want a pre-nuptial agreement, this rises to 53% of those making £40,000-59,999 a year, and 52% of those earning £60,000 a year or more.</p><h3>Do people think pre-nupital agreements are unromantic?</h3><p>But is asking for a pre-nup a distinctly unromantic thing to do? How would Britons feel if their intended was to ask them to sign one?</p><p>Three in ten (31%) say that their fiancée asking for a pre-nup would make them feel worse about their relationship, including 10% who say they would feel “much worse” about it.</p><p>A similar number (29%) say it wouldn’t make a difference, with most of the rest unsure (22%).</p><p>Older Britons are more likely to take offence at being asked for a pre-nup, with 35% of the over-50s saying so compared to 29% of those aged 25-49 and 15% of 18-24 year olds. By contrast, there is little difference in attitudes between men and women.</p><h3>Do people think pre-nups make divorce more likely?</h3><p>While many would feel worse at receiving a pre-nup request, far fewer think that they actually make it more likely that a marriage or civil partnership breaks down. Just 15% think that knowledge of what would happen financially if a marriage ended increases the chance of divorce, with 51% believing it makes no difference.</p><p>Men are more likely than women to think that pre-nups are harbingers of marriage doom, by 19% to 10%.</p><p>Younger people are slightly more confident than older people in thinking that they actually reduce the chances of divorce, at 15% of 18-24 year olds compared to 4% of those aged 65 and above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZWl%2BcnnAq5xmqKKaeq%2FBz62gmqRdlrSzscSmnKeso2LCr77OppinrJmY</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f45411-are-pre-nuptial-agreements-unromantic.html&text=Are%20pre-nuptial%20agreements%20unromantic%3f%20%7c%20YouGov&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f45411-are-pre-nuptial-agreements-unromantic.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f45411-are-pre-nuptial-agreements-unromantic.html&title=Are%20pre-nuptial%20agreements%20unromantic%3f%20%7c%20YouGov" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f45411-are-pre-nuptial-agreements-unromantic.html&title=Are%20pre-nuptial%20agreements%20unromantic%3f%20%7c%20YouGov" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f45411-are-pre-nuptial-agreements-unromantic.html&title=Are%20pre-nuptial%20agreements%20unromantic%3f%20%7c%20YouGov" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f45411-are-pre-nuptial-agreements-unromantic.html&description=Are%20pre-nuptial%20agreements%20unromantic%3f%20%7c%20YouGov" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-voice-final-battles-blake-shelton-pulls-off-one-massive-steal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Blake Shelton Pulls Off One Massive Steal">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ancient-history-of-scotland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ancient History of Scotland | Scotland.org">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
