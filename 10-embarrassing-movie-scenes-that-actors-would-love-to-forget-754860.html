Sometimes they agree to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;dubious film projects, other times they end up&nbsp;being exhausted both mentally and physically, and many times they’ll look silly without even realizing&nbsp;it. Actors will often laugh at&nbsp;themselves in&nbsp;embarrassment when recalling these experiences. They would definitely not agree to&nbsp;act in&nbsp;these scenes again, given the opportunity!</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>selected 10&nbsp;movie scenes that famous actors would rather forget about.</p><p><h2>Hugh Jackman&nbsp;— Movie&nbsp;43</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c6e/f99/a391da57a1a16aeb43ccbc8001.jpg><p>After his big success in&nbsp;Les Misérables, the actor <a href=# title="Hugh Jackman" data-link=tag>Hugh Jackman</a> lost his awareness and got involved in&nbsp;Movie 43&nbsp;which was an&nbsp;absurd comedy riddled with black humor. However, Jackman didn’t find the film funny at&nbsp;all. He&nbsp;even <a href=#>posted</a> a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;himself from the future on&nbsp;the internet where he&nbsp;warns himself against starring in&nbsp;Movie&nbsp;43.</p><p>The reason for this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene where Beth, played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a>, is&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;blind date with Davis, played by&nbsp;Hugh Jackman, who appears to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;“ball-neck”. Critics have left <a href=#>terrible</a> reviews about the movie and most of&nbsp;its actors didn’t even show up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the premiere.</p><p><h2>Arnold Schwarzenegger&nbsp;— Hercules in&nbsp;New York</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/250/8c3/ee5c385a3eb8d38b215fcdfa20.jpg><p>Unlike Hugh Jackman, <a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> <a href=#>recalls</a> his disastrous experience in&nbsp;the movie Hercules in&nbsp;New York with a&nbsp;laugh saying that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;cheap movie that he&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;because it’s really embarrassing and he’s embarrassing in&nbsp;it.</p><p>He&nbsp;felt most awkward during the scene where his character is&nbsp;fighting with a&nbsp;fake bear. “In&nbsp;one scene it’s me&nbsp;wrestling a&nbsp;bear and you could tell the bear in&nbsp;Central Park was not a&nbsp;bear, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;guy with this coat thrown over him. It&nbsp;was ridiculous,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>says</a>.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Lawrence&nbsp;— Passengers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fe/716/ef9f755422a32766214f6f4523.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lawrence</a> <a href=#>confessed</a> that she was less than thrilled before shooting the love scene in&nbsp;the movie Passengers. The actress was worried because it&nbsp;was the first time she had to&nbsp;get naked on&nbsp;camera and her married co-star <a href=# title="Chris Pratt" data-link=tag>Chris Pratt</a> added even more stress to&nbsp;the situation.</p><p>After they shot the scene, Lawrence came back home but her worries only grew stronger, “What have I&nbsp;done? I&nbsp;don’t know. And he&nbsp;was married. And it&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;my&nbsp;first time kissing a&nbsp;married man, and guilt is&nbsp;the worst feeling in&nbsp;your stomach. And I&nbsp;knew it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;job, but&nbsp;I couldn’t tell my&nbsp;stomach that. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;mom, and&nbsp;I was like, ’Will you just tell me&nbsp;it’s OK?’ That was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been.”</p><p><h2>Martin Sheen&nbsp;— Apocalypse Now</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d35/9bf/3385eb577db9d0d5e395de9e97.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the initial scene of&nbsp;the legendary movie Apocalypse Now, being quite drunk and exhausted, Captain Willard makes a&nbsp;mess in&nbsp;his hotel room. The character scatters everything around him, breaks the mirror with his fist, and plunges into an&nbsp;agonizing depression, his body bleeding. It&nbsp;would’ve been okay but the actor was actually drunk during the shooting process.</p><p>The next day when Sheen returned to&nbsp;this room and saw the blood on&nbsp;the bed, he&nbsp;was horrified. The actor was feeling shameful and couldn’t believe it&nbsp;was him who did&nbsp;it. Later, Martin Sheen <a href=#>confessed</a> to&nbsp;the director of&nbsp;the movie, Francis Ford Coppola, that he&nbsp;never rewatched this scene and still refuses to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so.</p><p><h2>Nicole Kidman&nbsp;— Big Little Lies</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d6c/225/0d8b5c575db402c66d4f8c7501.png><p>The actress <a href=# title="Nicole Kidman" data-link=tag>Nicole Kidman</a> played a&nbsp;young woman named Celeste who suffered from an&nbsp;abusive husband in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series Big Little Lies. She was a&nbsp;sophisticated, educated woman who had to&nbsp;stand being humiliated by&nbsp;her husband in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;“save her marriage”. Seeing the scene where a&nbsp;beaten and shivering Celeste lies at&nbsp;the feet of&nbsp;her despot husband still makes Kidman clench her fists.</p><p>“I&nbsp;remember lying on&nbsp;the floor in&nbsp;the last episode, being in&nbsp;my&nbsp;underwear and having just been really thrown around. I&nbsp;just laid on&nbsp;the floor. I&nbsp;couldn’t get&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;get&nbsp;up,” Kidman <a href=#>said</a>. After the shoot, the depressed actress returned to&nbsp;her hotel. She was trying to&nbsp;open the door but the lock broke. Then Nicole picked up&nbsp;a&nbsp;stone from the ground and broke the window of&nbsp;her room with&nbsp;it. Kidman confessed she <a href=#>regretted</a> her burst of&nbsp;fury caused by&nbsp;the humiliating movie scene she took part&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>Bryan Cranston&nbsp;— Breaking Bad</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/567/17e/6707e552cb80da3cd15420207a.jpg><p>Actor Bryan Cranston who played Walter White in&nbsp;the Breaking Bad TV&nbsp;series can’t help shedding a&nbsp;tear whenever he&nbsp;<a href=#>recalls</a> shooting the scene where he&nbsp;sees his student Jesse’s dying girlfriend. In&nbsp;the scene, White sits there and watches the woman die without trying to&nbsp;help.</p><p>Cranston explains what he&nbsp;<a href=#>felt</a> at&nbsp;that moment by&nbsp;explaining, “My&nbsp;character first wanted to&nbsp;respond in&nbsp;a&nbsp;humane way: a&nbsp;person was choking to&nbsp;death, so&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop&nbsp;it, the impulse was to&nbsp;help. And then he&nbsp;stops himself because he&nbsp;realizes this is&nbsp;the same person who was just blackmailing him and threatening to&nbsp;expose his whole enterprise and everyone’s life would be&nbsp;turned upside down. But then&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;her again and I&nbsp;said, ’She’s just a&nbsp;girl&nbsp;— she could be&nbsp;my&nbsp;daughter.’” The actor had been playing this terrible scene over in&nbsp;his head for a&nbsp;long time and even blamed himself for the indifference of&nbsp;his character.</p><p><h2>Alfie Allen&nbsp;— Game of&nbsp;Thrones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/250/d63/c1d85e5e5e8b16fc295295539f.jpg><p>The episode titled, “Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken” has been <a href=#>rated</a> as&nbsp;the worst episode in&nbsp;the entire Game of&nbsp;Thrones TV&nbsp;series. The actor Alfie Allen who played Theon Greyjoy agrees with fans and confesses that the wedding night of&nbsp;Sansa Stark and Ramsay Bolton became the worst scene for him to&nbsp;shoot. The sad Bolton ordered Theon stay in&nbsp;the room and watch Stark’s humiliation.</p><p>This painful scene had shaken Allen so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;was reluctant to&nbsp;<a href=#>discuss</a> it&nbsp;for a&nbsp;long time. The actor said, “I&nbsp;don’t really want to&nbsp;talk about it&nbsp;all that much, but the Season 5&nbsp;scene that was the wedding night between Ramsay and Sansa was a&nbsp;horrible day to&nbsp;shoot. Sophie Turner is&nbsp;just such a&nbsp;mature, amazing lady that brings life and light onto the set in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many ways but it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;hard day. It&nbsp;really was a&nbsp;horrible day but Sophie really dealt with that issue very, very well.”</p><p><h2>Jessica Alba&nbsp;— Fantastic Four&nbsp;2: Rise of&nbsp;the Silver Surfer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e11/3de/ba9ca25cf69fd1000bf6d9f633.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2007, Jessica Alba played a&nbsp;superheroine, Susan Storm in&nbsp;the second part of&nbsp;Fantastic Four and it&nbsp;was then that she experienced a&nbsp;true blow to&nbsp;her career. The director of&nbsp;the movie, Tim Story, literally <a href=#>made</a> the actress feel useless.</p><p>Jessica was supposed to&nbsp;start crying in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the scenes. She was trying her best to&nbsp;look natural but Tim Story kept criticizing her by&nbsp;saying, “It&nbsp;looks too real. It&nbsp;looks too painful. Can you be&nbsp;prettier when you cry?” After all, the director asked Alba to&nbsp;not do&nbsp;anything with her face. “Don’t do&nbsp;that thing with your face. Just make it&nbsp;flat. We&nbsp;can CGI the tears&nbsp;in.” The actress took that comment very personally and almost quit being an&nbsp;actress altogether.</p><p><h2>Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson&nbsp;— Water for Elephants</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fb/3aa/57ba885d57a946b6e0efb65239.jpg><p>“Someone, bring a&nbsp;nose spray to&nbsp;Pattinson!” is&nbsp;probably what actress Reese Witherspoon would call the scene of&nbsp;her kissing Robert Pattinson in&nbsp;the movie, Water for Elephants. According to&nbsp;the script, the actress was supposed to&nbsp;kiss the then sick Twilight star but she <a href=#>recalls</a> it&nbsp;being disgusting. She explains, “He&nbsp;did have a&nbsp;very runny nose. It&nbsp;wasn’t appealing; it&nbsp;wasn’t pleasant.”</p><p>Shooting that love scene <a href=#>was</a> difficult for Pattinson as&nbsp;well. He&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;was doing it&nbsp;when&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;really bad cold. My&nbsp;nose is&nbsp;running all over the place, and it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the additional photography scenes, and Reese had this wig&nbsp;on, and literally, I&nbsp;was wiping my&nbsp;nose on&nbsp;her wig.”</p><p><h2>Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire&nbsp;— Don’s Plum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b77/1e9/f2a3f153869e4a7d737495ef02.jpg><p>It’s difficult for Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;Don’s Plum that they don’t feel <a href=#>ashamed</a>&nbsp;of. The characters in&nbsp;the movie exchange vulgar jokes, laugh at&nbsp;each other, pick their noses, and give emotional monologues in&nbsp;the bathroom mirror for 86&nbsp;long minutes.</p><p>The actors believe that taking part in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;project didn’t show them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good light. That’s why DiCaprio and Maguire decided to&nbsp;take over and sue, asking to&nbsp;ban the movie in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US and Canada. In&nbsp;his <a href=#>open letter</a> to&nbsp;the film’s unsatisfied actors, the producer Dale Wheatley reproaches them with insincerity and intends to&nbsp;regain the right to&nbsp;show Don’s Plum in&nbsp;these countries.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;the scenes from this list do&nbsp;you find most shocking? Do&nbsp;you feel pity for any of&nbsp;the actors on&nbsp;this list? We’d be&nbsp;glad to&nbsp;hear from you in&nbsp;the comments!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecSmmZqqopbAtLXNoGSmp6aesm6%2Fwp6lnqtdqbWiwIyamq2noqh6uLvUpZtmpJ%2Brsm7AzmadqKqXmsFug5Rtb29oXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-embarrassing-movie-scenes-that-actors-would-love-to-forget-754860.html&text=10%20Embarrassing%20Movie%20Scenes%20That%20Actors%20Would%20Love%20to%20Forget&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-embarrassing-movie-scenes-that-actors-would-love-to-forget-754860.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-embarrassing-movie-scenes-that-actors-would-love-to-forget-754860.html&title=10%20Embarrassing%20Movie%20Scenes%20That%20Actors%20Would%20Love%20to%20Forget" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-embarrassing-movie-scenes-that-actors-would-love-to-forget-754860.html&title=10%20Embarrassing%20Movie%20Scenes%20That%20Actors%20Would%20Love%20to%20Forget" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-embarrassing-movie-scenes-that-actors-would-love-to-forget-754860.html&title=10%20Embarrassing%20Movie%20Scenes%20That%20Actors%20Would%20Love%20to%20Forget" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-embarrassing-movie-scenes-that-actors-would-love-to-forget-754860.html&description=10%20Embarrassing%20Movie%20Scenes%20That%20Actors%20Would%20Love%20to%20Forget" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./10-traits-you-inherit-only-from-one-parent-813025.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Traits You Inherit Only From One Parent">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10-super-literal-german-words.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Best Literal German Words Translated to English">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
