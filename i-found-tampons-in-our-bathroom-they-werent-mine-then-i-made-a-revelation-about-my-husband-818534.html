But then, she started to&nbsp;notice that there were tampons in&nbsp;their bathroom, which obviously didn’t belong to&nbsp;her. To&nbsp;make things even worse, there were blood stains appearing periodically on&nbsp;their bathroom floor. When the woman confronted her husband, he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;clue about what was happening in&nbsp;their house. But the persistent woman went till the end and found out the <a href=# title=truth data-link=tag>truth</a> behind the strange things happening in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;woman wrote&nbsp;us to&nbsp;share her curious real life story.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f8/cc9/77f39d5738943cfbb1e54b2f79.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Paris wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and shared a&nbsp;story that once happened in&nbsp;her family. The woman’s finding might have cost her a&nbsp;happy family life, because really strange things were happening in&nbsp;her house.</p><p>Paris opened her letter, saying, «My&nbsp;husband George and&nbsp;I have been happily married for over 10&nbsp;years now. We’ve always been on&nbsp;the same wave, and we&nbsp;didn’t have secrets from one another. George is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family man, he&nbsp;loves me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I had no&nbsp;doubts that he&nbsp;had always been faithful to&nbsp;me. Up&nbsp;until one day when we&nbsp;have moved into our apartment 9&nbsp;months ago.»</p><p>The woman explained, «One day, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;long and exhausting business trip to&nbsp;another state. I&nbsp;was away for 8&nbsp;days, and all this time George and&nbsp;I spoke a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;the phone and texted each other in&nbsp;messengers. I&nbsp;was pretty much sure he&nbsp;missed&nbsp;me, just like I&nbsp;did.<br>When I&nbsp;returned home, the first thing&nbsp;I did was taking a&nbsp;shower, because it&nbsp;was hot outside and&nbsp;I was sweating profusely. So, I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the bathroom instantly after&nbsp;I got home from the airport. I&nbsp;opened one of&nbsp;the drawers in&nbsp;the bathroom and saw 4&nbsp;tampons lying there right on&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;my&nbsp;personal things. They didn’t belong to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;was dumbfounded.»</p><p><h2>The woman didn’t play guessing games and confronted her husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/30a/d68/52238357e1b1ef25fdd2bced1b.jpg><p>Paris said, «The only person who could actually explain to&nbsp;me&nbsp;the origin of&nbsp;these tampons, was George. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;rushed to&nbsp;him, with these tampons in&nbsp;my&nbsp;hand, and insisted that he&nbsp;must tell me&nbsp;where they came from. But he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;denial, he&nbsp;just opened his eyes wide and said something like, ’Why a&nbsp;man is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;know anything about the tampons that are meant for women? I&nbsp;thought they were yours!’»</p><p>Paris was absolutely shocked, but having received no&nbsp;clear explanation from her husband, she decided not to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;huge problem out of&nbsp;this incident. Apart from that, she was tired after her trip, so&nbsp;she just let it&nbsp;go.</p><p>But then, even more weird things started happening in&nbsp;their house. Paris wrote, «A&nbsp;few months ago, I&nbsp;started noticing tiny droplets of&nbsp;blood that were splattered on&nbsp;our bathroom floor and around the toilet. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;remembered instantly about the tampons&nbsp;I kept finding occasionally in&nbsp;our bathroom. I&nbsp;confronted George again, this time about the blood stains, and he&nbsp;said again that he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;clue about their origin.»</p><p><h2>Paris decided to&nbsp;make her own investigation on&nbsp;the bizarre things happening in&nbsp;her family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b7/1e4/eb07cc505d80eca2558ef6a3e7.jpg><p>Paris wrote, «One day, I&nbsp;found 2&nbsp;more tampons in&nbsp;our house. This time they were placed in&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s drawer near our bed, where he&nbsp;usually keeps his glasses, his pocket books and his other stuff. This was the last straw, I&nbsp;called him and showed him the tampons again, and he&nbsp;started rambling, then told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;had terrible nose bleeds and used these tampons for stopping the bleeding. I&nbsp;didn’t believe a&nbsp;single word he&nbsp;was saying, because&nbsp;I did know he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;allergy which caused him a&nbsp;severe allergic rhinitis, but throughout our whole life together he&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;single nosebleed before.»</p><p>The woman wrote, «I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;camera inside our bathroom and in&nbsp;our bedroom, too. Of&nbsp;course, I&nbsp;didn’t tell George about that, and&nbsp;I even pretended to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;what he&nbsp;was saying about his nosebleeds. I&nbsp;then went on&nbsp;another ’business trip’, when in&nbsp;fact, I&nbsp;was staying for 3&nbsp;days at&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’. I&nbsp;wanted him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;relaxed about everything and to&nbsp;give himself out.»</p><p><h2>The unexpected truth was revealed very quickly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4cb/d81/a9ac225906ab34eeb7af104ce5.jpg><p>Paris wrote, «So, I&nbsp;came back from my ’business trip’ and waited for George to&nbsp;leave home so&nbsp;that&nbsp;I could monitor the video recordings from the cams. When I&nbsp;started watching them, at&nbsp;first there was nothing criminal, except for him eating in&nbsp;the bed, which&nbsp;I totally hate him doing. But then, I&nbsp;saw how George was applying some nose spray and then blowing his nose. He&nbsp;then got visibly annoyed, I&nbsp;guess he&nbsp;mumbled something like, ’Oh, no, again!’ and took a&nbsp;tampon from his drawer, then he&nbsp;used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop the nosebleed he&nbsp;was obviously having after blowing his nose.»</p><p>So, George was telling the truth when he&nbsp;was explaining to&nbsp;his wife that he&nbsp;had the nosebleeds. But Paris was concerned about the conspiracy George created over the whole thing. So, she waited for him to&nbsp;come back home and asked him the questions straightforwardly.</p><p>Paris wrote, «It&nbsp;turned out that George bought some nasal spray for relieving his allergy. Before that, he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;take pills for this purpose, but this time he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;try ’something new’. He&nbsp;didn’t read the instruction that came together with the spray and was using it&nbsp;randomly, in&nbsp;profuse amounts. This led to&nbsp;him having these nosebleeds. He&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;was having an&nbsp;issue with this spray, because he&nbsp;didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;start preaching him for the thing he&nbsp;usually does and that irritates me&nbsp;all our life together.<br>George never reads the instructions to&nbsp;anything he&nbsp;buys, he&nbsp;just uses everything at&nbsp;his own <a href=# title=intuition data-link=tag>intuition</a>, and it&nbsp;has led to&nbsp;many awkward things happening to&nbsp;him before. This time he&nbsp;did what he&nbsp;usually does, he&nbsp;threw the instruction in&nbsp;the garbage bin and used the spray without reading&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;was mad and relieved at&nbsp;the same time. With that being said, starting from that day, I&nbsp;double-check George’s medications and the way he&nbsp;takes them.»</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;witty woman who used <a href=#>a&nbsp;tampon</a> that she found in&nbsp;her boyfriend’s room to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;investigation and see if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was cheating on&nbsp;her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuss6upZ1lpJa6sbvNrGSipl2kwrN5wZqroaqfpLpuwMeesGavlaeyr8CMpqCnnV2ptaa6jKJkppmUmnqiedGerZ6kkam2sLqMmpmoraRiurp5x66qm5memXp5fZduam1n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-found-tampons-in-our-bathroom-they-werent-mine-then-i-made-a-revelation-about-my-husband-818534.html&text=I%20Found%20Tampons%20in%20Our%20Bathroom%2c%20They%20Werent%20Mine%2c%20Then%20I%20Made%20a%20Revelation%20About%20My%20Husband&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-found-tampons-in-our-bathroom-they-werent-mine-then-i-made-a-revelation-about-my-husband-818534.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-found-tampons-in-our-bathroom-they-werent-mine-then-i-made-a-revelation-about-my-husband-818534.html&title=I%20Found%20Tampons%20in%20Our%20Bathroom%2c%20They%20Werent%20Mine%2c%20Then%20I%20Made%20a%20Revelation%20About%20My%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-found-tampons-in-our-bathroom-they-werent-mine-then-i-made-a-revelation-about-my-husband-818534.html&title=I%20Found%20Tampons%20in%20Our%20Bathroom%2c%20They%20Werent%20Mine%2c%20Then%20I%20Made%20a%20Revelation%20About%20My%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-found-tampons-in-our-bathroom-they-werent-mine-then-i-made-a-revelation-about-my-husband-818534.html&title=I%20Found%20Tampons%20in%20Our%20Bathroom%2c%20They%20Werent%20Mine%2c%20Then%20I%20Made%20a%20Revelation%20About%20My%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-found-tampons-in-our-bathroom-they-werent-mine-then-i-made-a-revelation-about-my-husband-818534.html&description=I%20Found%20Tampons%20in%20Our%20Bathroom%2c%20They%20Werent%20Mine%2c%20Then%20I%20Made%20a%20Revelation%20About%20My%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-lopez-reveals-the-secret-behind-her-toned-body-at-53-812825.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Lopez Reveals the Secret Behind Her Toned Body at 53">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-will-american-idol-hopeful-claudia-conways-nude-photo-scandal-affect-the-competition-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Will 'American Idol' Hopeful Claudia Conway's Nude Photo Scandal Affect The Competition?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
