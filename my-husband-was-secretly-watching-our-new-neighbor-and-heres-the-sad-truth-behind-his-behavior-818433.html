The woman had the worst thoughts and guessing about what had been happening between them and why her devoted spouse suddenly got so&nbsp;interested about the young lady.

She asked&nbsp;us to&nbsp;publish her story so&nbsp;that other people could read it&nbsp;and maybe rethink their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> and their trust issues with their loved ones.</p><p>She began her story, saying, «Hi, <strong>Bright Side</strong>! I’m Grace, 39, and&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;very happy family with my&nbsp;husband, Frank, who’s 45. We’ve been married for almost 2&nbsp;decades, and before we&nbsp;tied the knot, we&nbsp;had known each other and dated for many years. We&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very small town and&nbsp;I can say we&nbsp;are happy together.<br>My&nbsp;husband is&nbsp;a&nbsp;manager at&nbsp;a&nbsp;local <a href=# title=store data-link=tag>store</a>. I&nbsp;have never been interested in&nbsp;the way he&nbsp;acts at&nbsp;work, but&nbsp;I made <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a> with 2&nbsp;other people who are the managers at&nbsp;the very same store, and we&nbsp;communicate with them, too. They always characterize my&nbsp;husband as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very hard-working person, who’s not indifferent about the lives of&nbsp;other people around him and who’ll always lend a&nbsp;hand if&nbsp;he&nbsp;sees that somebody is&nbsp;in&nbsp;trouble.»</p><p><h2>The happy relationship was endangered by&nbsp;Frank’s weird behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c96/d24/9416375319a9d82355e3e32ca2.jpg><p>Grace goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying that her husband Frank has always been a&nbsp;very devoted man. According to&nbsp;the woman, her spouse is&nbsp;a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;person, who lives for his family and makes the interests and wellbeing of&nbsp;his relatives his number one priority in&nbsp;life.</p><p>But all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, he&nbsp;started acting very strangely. Grace explained, «Recently, a&nbsp;new family, with 3&nbsp;kids, moved in&nbsp;across the road. One of&nbsp;their kids, a&nbsp;19-year-old girl Kate, happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;working in&nbsp;the same store as&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband. The area of&nbsp;our small town has the houses located very close to&nbsp;one another.<br>We&nbsp;have very narrow streets and low walls around our yards. Due to&nbsp;this peculiarity, we&nbsp;can have a&nbsp;view of&nbsp;our new neighbors’ shed. This shed has a&nbsp;glass roof and wooden walls, and we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;view of&nbsp;it&nbsp;only from upstairs. It’s also visible from a&nbsp;single spot in&nbsp;the <a href=# title=lounge data-link=tag>lounge</a> that gives Frank and I&nbsp;a view through the shed door window.»</p><p>The woman wrote that their new neighbor has actually become the reason for her to&nbsp;worry. She said, «I&nbsp;can see Kate in&nbsp;the shed all the time, while I’m passing a&nbsp;window. I&nbsp;don’t have an&nbsp;intention to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;her and&nbsp;I never stop to&nbsp;watch her, she’s just easy to&nbsp;notice. Kate often plays musical instruments in&nbsp;there, and the <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> can be&nbsp;heard sometimes. Oftentimes, Kate is&nbsp;just sitting in&nbsp;there, chilling. She spends a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time there, and&nbsp;I see her often.»</p><p>Grace noticed that her husband was interested in&nbsp;Kate. She said, «One day, I&nbsp;noticed that Frank was intentionally watching Kate through our windows. He’d go&nbsp;upstairs to&nbsp;the bedroom and&nbsp;I would often catch him looking out the window in&nbsp;that direction.»</p><p><h2>Things were becoming very tense in&nbsp;the family.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b64/d4f/15582558778fba6aed984cd81b.jpg><p>Grace said, «Frank started sitting on&nbsp;the sofa beside the window in&nbsp;the lounge. He&nbsp;didn’t normally sit there, and he&nbsp;actually disliked that place before. But that was the only spot in&nbsp;the lounge we&nbsp;could see into the shed from, and he&nbsp;used it&nbsp;to&nbsp;watch Kate from there.»</p><p>Grace added, «This weird behavior was happening every day. At&nbsp;first, I&nbsp;thought that maybe Frank was listening to&nbsp;Kate play her instruments. But many times&nbsp;I caught him looking, and&nbsp;I checked myself, and she would be&nbsp;just chilling, without making any music.»</p><p>Adding fuel to&nbsp;the fire, Grace’s friends, who worked at&nbsp;the same store with Frank, have mentioned to&nbsp;her how he&nbsp;helped Kate out even when she didn’t really need&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;was very patient and kind to&nbsp;her, which was natural for him, but this time Grace was alarmed.</p><p>The woman said, «I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;believe that this all was because Kate was a&nbsp;newcomer or&nbsp;because she was just young, and Frank had fatherly feelings towards her. But, on&nbsp;the other hand, they have newcomers all the time and the majority of&nbsp;them are young, and he&nbsp;wasn’t so&nbsp;much attentive to&nbsp;anyone before.»</p><p>The woman concluded that her husband did have a&nbsp;crush on&nbsp;Kate. She started worrying about it&nbsp;even more when Frank would avoid any conversations about Kate. This all was getting very unhealthy, according to&nbsp;Grace.</p><p><h2>The truth appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very different from what Grace thought from the start.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/692/2e0/bf948e57f894568d7fa62211f5.jpg><p>One day, Grace felt she had enough. After another episode of&nbsp;Frank watching Kate through the window, she confronted him directly about the painful issue. She said, «Once I&nbsp;caught Frank doing this very weird thing again, I&nbsp;just sat him down and insisted that&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;him. I&nbsp;didn’t accuse him of&nbsp;anything directly, but&nbsp;I urged him to&nbsp;give me&nbsp;an&nbsp;explanation for why he&nbsp;kept watching Kate and why he&nbsp;was treating her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special way at&nbsp;work. He&nbsp;instantly went pale, then he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was sorry, that he&nbsp;hadn’t even worried about how what he&nbsp;was doing would look from my&nbsp;own perspective.»</p><p>Frank then told Grace that one of&nbsp;the managers he&nbsp;works with, Lee, is&nbsp;Kate’s uncle. Kate has been off from work on&nbsp;a&nbsp;temporary basis, because Lee caught her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very poor state recently. The girl was hysteric, she was sobbing, and she was out of&nbsp;her mind because of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=pain data-link=tag>pain</a> she was living with.</p><p>Grace wrote, «Frank told me&nbsp;that Lee spoke to&nbsp;Kate about what was happening in&nbsp;her life that made her so&nbsp;upset. He&nbsp;then found out that she was gay, and she was really struggling because her parents wouldn’t accept her. Lee couldn’t tell Kate’s parents about her state and about the fact that she was off from work and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very poor condition. So, what Lee actually did was he&nbsp;asked my&nbsp;husband to&nbsp;keep an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;Kate as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;he&nbsp;could to&nbsp;make sure she was okay and that she wasn’t having that meltdowns anymore.»</p><p>Frank told Grace that part of&nbsp;the reason he&nbsp;was taking Kate’s case so&nbsp;seriously was because 11&nbsp;years ago, his cousin came out as&nbsp;gay, and he&nbsp;also faced a&nbsp;very tough situation in&nbsp;the family because of&nbsp;this. Frank was the only person, out of&nbsp;the whole family, who helped his cousin. He&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;his parents and the situation in&nbsp;their family normalized, because Frank was very persuasive and acted out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good will.</p><p>Grace revealed, «Frank told me&nbsp;that this situation with Kate made him realize there were faults in&nbsp;our own relationship. This was because he&nbsp;didn’t think&nbsp;I would pay so&nbsp;much attention to&nbsp;him watching Kate, and he&nbsp;admitted to&nbsp;his mistake. We&nbsp;decided that we’ll pay for Kate’s therapy and since then we’re friends with Kate, helping her to&nbsp;survive from the tough times she’s having in&nbsp;her family.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story about one woman’s nasty neighbors, who didn’t like the color of&nbsp;her house. When she refused to&nbsp;repaint&nbsp;it, these people went very far. <a href=#>Read more</a> to&nbsp;find out what they did and what repercussions it&nbsp;brought them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6uK3SZqqem6Kawa3FjLCYrZuYnruoec6uqWamlax6r7HIoJ%2Bbp6Jirq%2BwjKGcq52jYsGpsYysmJ1lpKfCtbSMm5yhoZ6Zeqm10maZnqCRq7awvoxxaHFsY2h8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-husband-was-secretly-watching-our-new-neighbor-and-heres-the-sad-truth-behind-his-behavior-818433.html&text=My%20Husband%20Was%20Secretly%20Watching%20Our%20New%20Neighbor%2c%20and%20Heres%20the%20Sad%20Truth%20Behind%20His%20Behavior&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-husband-was-secretly-watching-our-new-neighbor-and-heres-the-sad-truth-behind-his-behavior-818433.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-husband-was-secretly-watching-our-new-neighbor-and-heres-the-sad-truth-behind-his-behavior-818433.html&title=My%20Husband%20Was%20Secretly%20Watching%20Our%20New%20Neighbor%2c%20and%20Heres%20the%20Sad%20Truth%20Behind%20His%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-husband-was-secretly-watching-our-new-neighbor-and-heres-the-sad-truth-behind-his-behavior-818433.html&title=My%20Husband%20Was%20Secretly%20Watching%20Our%20New%20Neighbor%2c%20and%20Heres%20the%20Sad%20Truth%20Behind%20His%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-husband-was-secretly-watching-our-new-neighbor-and-heres-the-sad-truth-behind-his-behavior-818433.html&title=My%20Husband%20Was%20Secretly%20Watching%20Our%20New%20Neighbor%2c%20and%20Heres%20the%20Sad%20Truth%20Behind%20His%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-husband-was-secretly-watching-our-new-neighbor-and-heres-the-sad-truth-behind-his-behavior-818433.html&description=My%20Husband%20Was%20Secretly%20Watching%20Our%20New%20Neighbor%2c%20and%20Heres%20the%20Sad%20Truth%20Behind%20His%20Behavior" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-cymru-can-strategy-unveiled-future-generations-commissioner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Cymru Can strategy unveiled by Future Generations Commissioner">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mapping-scooters-explosive-growth-state-by-state-and-country-by-country.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mapping Scooters Explosive Growth, State by State and Country by Country">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
