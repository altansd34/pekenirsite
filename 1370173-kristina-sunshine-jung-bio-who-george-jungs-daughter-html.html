Sunshine had a challenging time growing up as she was deprived of parental care.</p><p class=align-left>Both her mother and father had criminal pasts. Therefore, they were not around her most of the time. Kristina Sunshine Jung's mother, <a href=#>Mirtha Jung</a>, had plugged herself deep into illegal substances. She was an addict until Kristina was around four years old.</p><p class=align-left>Mirtha consumed a lot of substances while she was expectant. This led to a hard time during delivery. Later, she was jailed for substance possession when Kristina was still a little girl. By the time she was going to prison, Mirtha Jung was already divorced from George.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Sunshine's father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">George Jung</a>, was sentenced to 21 years in jail after being found guilty of smuggling illegal substances. Jung said he didn't think what he was doing was wrong because the substances he was bringing in were accepted during the 1960s.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/997a31bd4f80400f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emily Threlkeld: get to know more about Harold Ford Jr.'s wife</span></p></a><h3>Who raised Kristina Sunshine Jung?</h3><p class=align-left>Sunshine was raised by her grandparents, Ermine and Federick Jung.
