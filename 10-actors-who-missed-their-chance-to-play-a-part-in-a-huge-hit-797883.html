But there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;doubt that one of&nbsp;the most important questions in&nbsp;any actor’s <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> is&nbsp;which roles to&nbsp;take and which ones to&nbsp;let pass&nbsp;by. After all, <a href=# title=filming data-link=tag>filming</a> takes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time and work, and they can only participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;limited number of&nbsp;projects from year to&nbsp;year. They might look back and see that refusing to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;project was clearly the way to&nbsp;go, but we&nbsp;can’t help but wonder what would’ve happened if&nbsp;some of&nbsp;those actors would have taken those missed opportunities.</p><p>So&nbsp;with that in&nbsp;mind, <strong>Bright Side</strong> did a&nbsp;little research and made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;celebrities who rejected freshly written scripts that ended up&nbsp;being big hits on&nbsp;the big screen.</p><p><h2>1. Emma Roberts could have played a&nbsp;starring role in&nbsp;Spring Breakers but she had creative differences with the director.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8d/aa3/1e5a6a5ccf8f944195d00f22fe.jpg><p>Roberts, who starred in&nbsp;Scream Queens and American Horror Story, was on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;playing a&nbsp;<a href=#>leading role</a> in&nbsp;Spring Breakers, together with <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> and <a href=#>Vanessa Hudgens</a>. Why did she choose to&nbsp;not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the film? Director Harmony Korine explained that he&nbsp;and Roberts had “creative differences.” Finally, the character that <a href=#>Roberts</a> was supposed to&nbsp;play was taken over by&nbsp;the star of&nbsp;the series Pretty Little Liars, <a href=#>Ashley Benson</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Emma Stone turned down a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the female version of&nbsp;Ghostbusters because it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;franchise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/991/9fc/cb8e275e9d9d8d6145be225939.jpg><p>The multi-award winning American actress and singer had just starred in&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man. This was one of&nbsp;the reasons she rejected the proposal to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;the all-female version of&nbsp;<a href=#>Ghostbusters</a> (2016). <a href=#>Stone</a> read the script and found it&nbsp;<a href=#>very funny</a>, but she didn’t feel that it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;get back into a&nbsp;franchise, due to&nbsp;the commitment that this kind of&nbsp;project entails. In&nbsp;the end, the stars of&nbsp;the film were Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones, and Kate McKinnon.</p><p><h2>3. Rachel McAdams was the first choice for the starring role in&nbsp;The Devil Wears Prada, but she turned down the role on&nbsp;more than one occasion.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f42/70a/0419955763bd17294823a2724b.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Devil Wears Prada</a> without <a href=#>Anne Hathaway</a> as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the main characters, but this is&nbsp;exactly what could have happened if&nbsp;<a href=#>Rachel McAdams</a> had accepted one of&nbsp;the many <a href=#>invitations</a> from Fox, the film’s producer, to&nbsp;play the leading role. <a href=# title=McAdams data-link=tag>McAdams</a> might regret making that call, and with reason, since the film was a&nbsp;huge success at&nbsp;the box office. It&nbsp;made more than $300 million and managed to&nbsp;get 2&nbsp;Oscar nominations.</p><p><h2>4. Jennifer Lawrence met with Tarantino to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cast for The Hateful Eight, but she was caught in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;2&nbsp;projects and had no&nbsp;time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c27/5c4/a20758582a9cc21144706fb414.jpg><p>Quentin Tarantino, director of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Hateful Eight</a>, wanted <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> to&nbsp;play the female lead in&nbsp;his movie. He&nbsp;met with the actress, but according to&nbsp;the director, that talk might have just been the <a href=#>polite</a> thing to&nbsp;do. Back then, Lawrence was too busy shooting Joy and still in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;an&nbsp;intense publicity campaign for The Hunger Games. Finally, Tarantino reconsidered and decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for <a href=#>Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>, who gave a&nbsp;different feel to&nbsp;the character, being 28&nbsp;years older than Lawrence. Tarantino hit the nail on&nbsp;the head and Jason Leigh was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar for her performance.</p><p><h2>5. Warner Bros. bought the script of&nbsp;The Imitation Game for Leonardo DiCaprio to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;it, but then had to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;up&nbsp;because the actor never formalized anything.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acc/906/d0dd0e5b359dcf98c63734ca77.jpg><p>In&nbsp;this case, the role that was rejected by&nbsp;DiCaprio was that of&nbsp;famous mathematician <a href=#>Alan Turing</a> in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Imitation Game</a>. At&nbsp;some point, Warner Bros. even managed to&nbsp;buy the rights to&nbsp;the story because <a href=#>DiCaprio</a> showed interest in&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;the movie. However, the actor never formalized anything and the production company ended up&nbsp;dropping the whole thing. Eventually, the copyright was acquired by&nbsp;Black Bear Pictures and the role of&nbsp;Turing was given to&nbsp;<a href=#>Benedict Cumberbatch</a>. It&nbsp;earned him a&nbsp;Best Actor nomination at&nbsp;the Oscars.</p><p><h2>6. Matthew McConaughey had to&nbsp;choose between joining an&nbsp;already successful franchise or&nbsp;starting one from scratch.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f11/946/5e4414565091fa66f82c669f6f.jpg><p>The actor had to&nbsp;choose between 2&nbsp;big franchises: <a href=#>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy Vol. 2</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>The Dark Tower</a>. He&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;choosing the latter, which is&nbsp;an&nbsp;adaptation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;novels written by&nbsp;Stephen King. McConaughey’s reasoning was that since <a href=#>Guardians of&nbsp;the Galaxy </a>had turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;such a&nbsp;success, for the second installment they had the opportunity to&nbsp;make room for a&nbsp;more famous actor, but that would have made him feel like a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;amendment. However The Dark Tower franchise was brand new, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;figured he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;give the character his <a href=#>own touch</a> and let him grow with the movies. Little did he&nbsp;know that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;flop at&nbsp;the box office.</p><p><h2>7. Willow Smith, at&nbsp;age&nbsp;12, stood up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her father Will Smith and left Annie.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d59/ee2/be22485f45a2065dac01039651.jpg><p>The remake of&nbsp;the musical rom-com <a href=#>Annie</a> was originally meant to&nbsp;have <a href=#>Willow Smith</a>, Will Smith’s daughter, as&nbsp;its star. Will coincidentally happened to&nbsp;also be&nbsp;the producer of&nbsp;the film. Willow was just a&nbsp;child at&nbsp;the time, but despite her father’s enthusiasm, she dropped out of&nbsp;the project after having a&nbsp;difficult time on&nbsp;her tour with Whip My&nbsp;Hair. Her father tried to&nbsp;<a href=#>convince</a> her to&nbsp;not quit, by&nbsp;telling her that she could bring her friends to&nbsp;the set and that she would meet Beyoncé. However, Willow was crystal clear when replying: “Daddy, I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;better idea, how about&nbsp;I just be&nbsp;12.” Finally, the role was played by&nbsp;Quvenzhané Wallis, who won a&nbsp;Golden Globe nomination.</p><p><h2>8. Miles Teller would have danced and sung in&nbsp;La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land instead of&nbsp;Ryan Gosling, but production couldn’t reach an&nbsp;agreement.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b6/4ae/f443bf59ad8d18f968580dd40e.jpg><p>Sebastian’s role in&nbsp;<a href=#>La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land</a> was originally written for <a href=#>Miles Teller</a>, but after long contract <a href=#>negotiations</a>, the actor stepped aside. Finally, the director turned to&nbsp;Ryan Gosling, who was 7&nbsp;years older than Teller. <a href=#>Gosling</a> even had to&nbsp;<a href=#>learn</a> to&nbsp;play the piano for the role. But in&nbsp;the end, it&nbsp;seems like all the effort paid off: thanks to&nbsp;the great performance he&nbsp;delivered, he&nbsp;won a&nbsp;Golden Globe and was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar as&nbsp;Best Actor.</p><p><h2>9. Molly Ringwald, a&nbsp;rising star in&nbsp;the ’80s, was the first choice to&nbsp;take the leading role in&nbsp;Pretty Woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/266/393/28ce5e5c3ca60e75a45745f3fe.jpg><p>Many actresses were short-listed for Vivian’s role in&nbsp;<a href=#>Pretty Woman</a>. However, the first choice for director Garry Marshall was Molly Ringwald, who starred in&nbsp;iconic ’80s films like The Breakfast Club, Pretty in&nbsp;Pink, and Sixteen Candles. The actress read an&nbsp;<a href=#>early draft</a> of&nbsp;the script titled $3000 and declined the role. Eventually, Vivian would be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;<a href=#>Julia Roberts</a>, who was originally intended to&nbsp;just have a&nbsp;supporting role. Not only was the film a&nbsp;box office success (it&nbsp;grossed over $460&nbsp;million), but Roberts was nominated for an&nbsp;Academy Award and won a&nbsp;Golden Globe for Best Actress.</p><p><h2>10. Sandra Bullock could have played the boxer in&nbsp;Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby, but Miss Congeniality 2&nbsp;got in&nbsp;the way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66a/b27/896601558fb96e7f832bfcb809.jpg><p>What were the best decisions you made in&nbsp;your life?
