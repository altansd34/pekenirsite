Our today’s heroine is&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, 34, who was shaken by&nbsp;the attitude that her best friend of&nbsp;over 20&nbsp;years has demonstrated during her special day. The woman wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, and we&nbsp;could feel how she wanted to&nbsp;cry while telling&nbsp;us her <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a>.</p><p><h2>The friendship between two women seemed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very solid.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/456/c8f/6047ef58628dbd9c3207af5f5d.jpg><p>Alyson, 34, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, telling&nbsp;us about a&nbsp;heart-wrenching experience in&nbsp;her relationship with her childhood best friend, Miranda, 35. She began her story, saying, «My&nbsp;childhood best friend got married last weekend. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;excited and delighted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there to&nbsp;support her on&nbsp;her big day. Trashy things in&nbsp;our relationship started happening immediately.»</p><p>Alyson goes&nbsp;on, saying, «Right after Miranda asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;her bridesmaid, she said that she would make me&nbsp;dress in&nbsp;a ’girly’ way. She made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;requirements, that included a&nbsp;dress, heels, growing my&nbsp;hair to&nbsp;at&nbsp;least bob length. And I&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;dye my&nbsp;hair and get a&nbsp;tan. And what was the worst for&nbsp;me, that&nbsp;I definitely had to&nbsp;use body make up&nbsp;to&nbsp;cover my&nbsp;tattoos.»</p><p>Alyson explained why this all was a&nbsp;problem for her from the start. She wrote, «Since my&nbsp;teenage years, I&nbsp;have always been an&nbsp;absolute tomboy. I’ve always been feeling deeply uncomfortable wearing dresses and heels and makeup. But that was my&nbsp;best friend’s big day, so&nbsp;I offered to&nbsp;do&nbsp;all except grow my&nbsp;hair.» Then, Miranda told Alyson that she’d still be&nbsp;invited to&nbsp;her <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a>, but that she won’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bridesmaid anymore, to&nbsp;which Alyson agreed, though she was feeling totally bad about this all already.</p><p><h2>Things were getting worse from that point, and Alyson was getting annoyed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ba2/d01/ed8d3e5cdda791c188dcc69d76.jpg><p>Alyson goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «I’m a&nbsp;chocolatier, so&nbsp;Miranda asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;I could make the wedding favors and take full care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;dessert table. Though our relationship had been pretty much spoiled by&nbsp;her requirements to&nbsp;my&nbsp;appearance and the fact that she had reconsidered me&nbsp;being her bridesmaid, I&nbsp;was ecstatic to&nbsp;help her with everything. I&nbsp;went above and beyond to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;absolutely amazing table that was a&nbsp;tremendous hit of&nbsp;the day.»</p><p>Things, however, weren’t getting any better in&nbsp;Miranda’s attitude to&nbsp;Alyson. The woman shared, «She then told me&nbsp;that the wedding was approaching to&nbsp;the point where it&nbsp;would become over-budget and Miranda wanted to&nbsp;keep costs low. So, she said that my&nbsp;husband was not invited. I&nbsp;was fuming, but she was my&nbsp;best friend, and we’ve been through many things together. I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;all was the result of&nbsp;her pre-wedding stress, so&nbsp;I was extremely understanding and even reduced my&nbsp;rates for the table&nbsp;I arranged as&nbsp;my&nbsp;personal present to&nbsp;the couple.»</p><p><h2>The unfriendly attitude of&nbsp;the best friend didn’t stop at&nbsp;that crucial point.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/735/1d0/977b135300982808f741a1537a.jpg><p>Alyson wrote, «A&nbsp;month later, after reviewing the guest list, Miranda told me&nbsp;that my&nbsp;husband could still come with&nbsp;me, but if&nbsp;he&nbsp;did, I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;moved away from the head table.» Alyson shared that her husband is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;wedding photographer, and he&nbsp;was eager to&nbsp;build his videography portfolio. They knew that Miranda and her husband-to-be didn’t have a&nbsp;videographer.</p><p>Alyson’s husband then offered them to&nbsp;film a&nbsp;professional wedding video for them, and he&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that free of&nbsp;charge. The woman shared, «Miranda was ecstatic, and she suggested she would move&nbsp;us to&nbsp;the vendor table so&nbsp;that we&nbsp;could cooperate with the other vendors. We&nbsp;really liked the idea, and it&nbsp;was agreed that we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;sitting with the vendors.»</p><p>Then, things took a&nbsp;totally unhealthy turn. Alyson wrote, «The day of&nbsp;the wedding, my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I arrived 4&nbsp;hours early to&nbsp;help with the event. He&nbsp;spent the time filming while&nbsp;I was arranging the dessert table. After the ceremony, guests were moved to&nbsp;the party room and the original room was converted into the place for the reception. While helping with converting the room, I&nbsp;was thunderstruck to&nbsp;discover that my&nbsp;best friend actually didn’t add our names on&nbsp;the seating list.»</p><p>There appeared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;no&nbsp;vendor table and Alyson with her husband had to&nbsp;sit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate room as&nbsp;they were not on&nbsp;the list. That separate room was closed off from the reception, they couldn’t hear or&nbsp;see anything, and couldn’t even talk to&nbsp;anybody.</p><p><h2>Alyson is&nbsp;extremely hurt about the whole situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e70/095/8212195aa7b5dee778462e151d.jpg><p>Alyson said, «After we&nbsp;were suggested to&nbsp;sit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate room, I&nbsp;approached Miranda to&nbsp;explain the situation. She said that it&nbsp;was some mix-up. I&nbsp;understand it&nbsp;all, but Miranda didn’t do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;get&nbsp;us moved to&nbsp;the main room. We&nbsp;were just cut off from the reception. I&nbsp;missed the whole wedding and spent the majority of&nbsp;the evening sobbing in&nbsp;the bathroom. My&nbsp;husband continued to&nbsp;film everything, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;beautiful video for them.»</p><p>Alyson closed her letter saying, «After the whole situation, I&nbsp;texted Miranda and told her about my&nbsp;feelings. She started to&nbsp;apologize and explained she was scatterbrained during that day. She said she felt extremely guilty and wanted still to&nbsp;remain friends. And the only wish&nbsp;I have now is&nbsp;to&nbsp;never ever see her in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life again.»</p><p><h2>Advice from <strong>Bright Side</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b5/9d4/e66dcf506b963a996fde85bc67.jpg><p>We’re very grateful to&nbsp;Alyson for sharing her story with&nbsp;us, and we&nbsp;think that her feelings would be&nbsp;understood by&nbsp;many people.</p><p>Our advice to&nbsp;the woman would be&nbsp;as&nbsp;simple as&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;nothing about the situation. We&nbsp;think that Alyson has done enough for her friend already, and she has shown a&nbsp;true commitment to&nbsp;their friendship, appearing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real friend.</p><p>But Miranda was acting in&nbsp;a&nbsp;wrong way, so&nbsp;Alyson has nothing to&nbsp;apologize for, and it’s her right to&nbsp;cut all ties with Miranda after this incident. Even if&nbsp;the two women restore their <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>, we’d advise Alyson to&nbsp;keep the certain boundaries between her and Miranda in&nbsp;the future and to&nbsp;never treat Miranda as&nbsp;an&nbsp;absolute friend of&nbsp;hers.</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story from a&nbsp;woman, whose feelings were meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hurt by&nbsp;her neighbor. But she didn’t let frustration take over her, and got back to&nbsp;an&nbsp;offender with a&nbsp;<a href=#>petty revenge</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecGeqq1llqe2prrDZqafZWJlerqxwKuqZqGeq7a1scNmpJ5lpKR6qbHRZq6enJSeu6h5wKebZqGkYsSiv4ytn55lp6S%2FtMCMnZiyZZ%2Bbeq7FjKWgn51dbX55f5VvZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-best-friend-of-20-years-invited-me-to-her-wedding-and-it-was-the-worst-day-of-my-life-818366.html&text=My%20Best%20Friend%20of%2020%20Years%20Invited%20Me%20to%20Her%20Wedding%2c%20and%20It%20Was%20the%20Worst%20Day%20of%20My%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-best-friend-of-20-years-invited-me-to-her-wedding-and-it-was-the-worst-day-of-my-life-818366.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-best-friend-of-20-years-invited-me-to-her-wedding-and-it-was-the-worst-day-of-my-life-818366.html&title=My%20Best%20Friend%20of%2020%20Years%20Invited%20Me%20to%20Her%20Wedding%2c%20and%20It%20Was%20the%20Worst%20Day%20of%20My%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-best-friend-of-20-years-invited-me-to-her-wedding-and-it-was-the-worst-day-of-my-life-818366.html&title=My%20Best%20Friend%20of%2020%20Years%20Invited%20Me%20to%20Her%20Wedding%2c%20and%20It%20Was%20the%20Worst%20Day%20of%20My%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-best-friend-of-20-years-invited-me-to-her-wedding-and-it-was-the-worst-day-of-my-life-818366.html&title=My%20Best%20Friend%20of%2020%20Years%20Invited%20Me%20to%20Her%20Wedding%2c%20and%20It%20Was%20the%20Worst%20Day%20of%20My%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-best-friend-of-20-years-invited-me-to-her-wedding-and-it-was-the-worst-day-of-my-life-818366.html&description=My%20Best%20Friend%20of%2020%20Years%20Invited%20Me%20to%20Her%20Wedding%2c%20and%20It%20Was%20the%20Worst%20Day%20of%20My%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mymail-co-uk.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="mymail.co.uk popularity &amp;amp; fame | YouGov">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1233626-mel-gibson-net-worth-height-wife-children-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mel Gibson net worth, height, wife, children">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
