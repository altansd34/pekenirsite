She signed to Big Machine Records following her win. After nearly nine years, Bradbery released an album that encompasses her entire music career.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Voice Season Four Winner Releases Album That Shares Her Journey in Music</h2><p>On March 4, Bradbery dropped her 10 track album In Between: The Collection. When teasing the release of this album, the singer included a long Instagram caption explaining the journey behind the album. She shared that she’s spent the past nine years finding her voice, so she wanted this album to express that.</p><p>The first half of the album shows off her country side, while the other half infuses R&B, pop, and rock into her storytelling. Bradbery emphasized that In Between: The Collection is reminiscing on the past, but it doesn’t mean she’s leaving country music.</p><p>Bradbery’s album features eight songs released earlier in her career, one premiered during the Toyota U.S. Figure Skating Championships: Prevagen Skating Spectacular, and a brand new song. The brand new song on the album is track four, “Look At The Mess I’m In.” Fans of the singer were stoked to hear about this release.</p><p>Bradbery is known for creating music filled with personal stories, so this is no surprise out of the singer. Reports state that she spent her time creating music she loves during the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, she released two singles, “Never Have I Ever,” and “Girls In My Hometown.”</p><p>This singer has been successful following her time on The Voice, so it’s no surprise that her newest album debuted on the iTunes chart. In Between: The Collection debuted at No. 28 on the iTunes U.S. Albums chart. It has remained on the chart even four days after the release.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fans Are Happy to Hear Brand New Single</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Fans were most excited to hear Bradbery’s brand new single on the album “Look At The Mess I’m In.” Even though it’s her newest song, it lives within side A of her new album. Bradbery premieres amazingly smooth runs filled with passion in the new song. Fans flooded the comments of the video expressing that this song shouldn’t have been left on the backburner for so long. They love the lyrics that tell a post break up story.</p><p>When listening through this album, there’s an obvious genre shift, like the singer expresses. The first song, “Stop Draggin’ Your Boots” features a strong country theme including plenty of acoustic guitars. Bradbery recently released a performance video of this song on YouTube that includes her wearing a black cowboy hat, which is key in this comparison.</p><p>Her side B track “Break My Heart Again” lingers more toward the genre of pop than country. It still contains the strong lyrics and piano base, but differs in the fact that there’s no strong guitar presence. Similar to the other song, “Break My Heart Again” features heartfelt lyrics and more silky smooth runs. I think the biggest difference between the two songs in relation to their videos is the fact that Bradbery isn’t wearing a cowboy hat in her performance of “Break My Heart Again.”</p><p>I think this song is the perfect representation of Bradbery’s new chapter. She doesn’t want to sway too far from country music, but subtle hints of the genre still lie within the song and storytelling. Even though “Break My Heart Again” doesn’t have a super strong country base, fans still love it. Many have commented on the video expressing that her voice is extremely versatile and they love her voice regardless of the song’s main genre.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-danielle-bradbery-wins-the-voice-at-16-years-old>Danielle Bradbery Wins The Voice at 16 Years Old</h2><p>Season four was filled with country artists, but Bradbery stuck out because of her likability and charisma. Adam Levine, Kelly Clarkson, and Blake Shelton wanted to mentor the 16 year old singer after hearing her sing “Mean” by Taylor Swift in the blind auditions. She flew through the competition on Team Blake and was a clear frontrunner during the Live Playoffs.</p><p>Bradbery made history on her season of The Voice. Even though her season ended nearly nine years ago, she is remembered as the first artist in the history of the show to land on the iTunes Top 10 during the Live Playoffs. On top of that, she was the second winner of the series overall, as well as the youngest winner of the show at the time.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1198584316.jpg alt="Monique Heart Shares Impact of Conversion Therapy During ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Vs. the World’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>danielle bradbery</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedaipaedomKxorrInqOlnV2Xv6KwwZ6psmWimrmmrdKeqmahnmKvpsDWnpynZaSdsm6vzqWjnpuknryvew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-voice-winner-danielle-bradbery-releases-in-between-the-collection.html&text=%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Danielle%20Bradbery%20Releases%20%27In%20Between%3a%20The%20Collection%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-voice-winner-danielle-bradbery-releases-in-between-the-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-voice-winner-danielle-bradbery-releases-in-between-the-collection.html&title=%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Danielle%20Bradbery%20Releases%20%27In%20Between%3a%20The%20Collection%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-voice-winner-danielle-bradbery-releases-in-between-the-collection.html&title=%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Danielle%20Bradbery%20Releases%20%27In%20Between%3a%20The%20Collection%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-voice-winner-danielle-bradbery-releases-in-between-the-collection.html&title=%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Danielle%20Bradbery%20Releases%20%27In%20Between%3a%20The%20Collection%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-voice-winner-danielle-bradbery-releases-in-between-the-collection.html&description=%27The%20Voice%27%20Winner%20Danielle%20Bradbery%20Releases%20%27In%20Between%3a%20The%20Collection%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1349721-100-fun-hypothetical-questions-bust-bored-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="100+ fun hypothetical questions to bust out when you are bored">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dancing-with-the-stars-cast-gets-slammed-with-pay-cuts-amid-move-to-disney.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Dancing With the Stars' Cast Gets Slammed With Pay Cuts Amid Move to Disney +">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
