According to the National Audubon Society, crows flap their wings in flight, whereas ravens fly more like raptors by using thermal air currents to soar. Ravens make a swishing sound while the crows beat their wings silently.</p><p class=align-left>Because crows' tail feathers are generally uniform in length, they have a fan-shaped appearance in flight.

However, ravens typically travel in pairs, while crows are prone to travel in larger groups. Crows like being in human-populated areas and are, therefore, likely to be seen in urban landscapes, while ravens prefer livestock and sheep and are mainly found in wilder areas.</p><p class=align-left>Hearing their calls, you can tell the difference between a crow and a raven. Ravens call with a deeper, throatier croaking sound, while crows make an even caw, caw sound.
