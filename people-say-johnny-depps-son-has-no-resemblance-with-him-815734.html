What’s intriguing about their love story is&nbsp;that, despite their long time together and the <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> they built, the couple never officially tied the knot in&nbsp;marriage.</p><p>Their decision to&nbsp;remain unmarried was a&nbsp;personal choice, and it&nbsp;resonated with their desire for privacy and a&nbsp;non-traditional approach to&nbsp;their relationship. However, throughout their time together, Johnny and Vanessa’s love story was marked by&nbsp;their shared experiences, artistic endeavors, and their joint journey of&nbsp;raising their two children, Lily-Rose and Jack.</p><p>Their love story started in&nbsp;the late <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>’90s</a>, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;quaint hotel in&nbsp;France. Sparks flew, and before they knew&nbsp;it, they were head over heels in&nbsp;love. But their love story didn’t just stop at&nbsp;<a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a>. It&nbsp;blossomed into a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beautiful family</a>.</p><p>In&nbsp;1999, they celebrated the arrival of&nbsp;their first bundle of&nbsp;joy, a&nbsp;daughter named Lily-Rose Melody Depp. That moment marked the beginning of&nbsp;their journey as&nbsp;parents. Johnny and Vanessa were dedicated mom and dad, trying their best to&nbsp;give their kid a&nbsp;taste of&nbsp;the ordinary life they never had.</p><p>Then, in&nbsp;2002, their family got even more awesome as&nbsp;they welcomed their son, John Christopher “Jack” Depp III. With two little ones running around, Johnny and Vanessa’s bond as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family grew stronger by&nbsp;the day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfa/ed4/ad1a385bdfb0d9b49237790646.jpg><p>Khayat Nicolas/ABACA/EAST NEWS</p><p>Talking about their bond, Vanessa <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> at&nbsp;the time: “He’s got&nbsp;me, and he&nbsp;knows he’s got&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;love the romance of ’Let’s get married,’ but then when you have it&nbsp;so&nbsp;perfect, I&nbsp;mean, I’m more married than anybody can be&nbsp;— we&nbsp;have two kids. Maybe one day, but it’s something&nbsp;I can really do&nbsp;without.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the couple split in&nbsp;2012, but Johnny Depp said they had “amicably separated” and asked for privacy for their family. Their daughter, Lily-Rose, was just 13&nbsp;years old when her parents split. Surprisingly, despite the challenges that often come with a&nbsp;separation, Lily-Rose shared that her teenage years had been pretty relaxed and easy-going. Johnny, on&nbsp;the other hand, was more open about how he&nbsp;was coping post-separation.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2013</a>&nbsp;interview, “At&nbsp;times, certainly unpleasant, but that’s the nature of&nbsp;breakups, I&nbsp;guess, especially when there are kiddies involved.” He&nbsp;added, “It&nbsp;doesn’t stop the fact that you care for that person, and they’re the mother of&nbsp;your kids. <strong>You’ll always know each other, and you’re always gonna be&nbsp;in&nbsp;each other’s lives because of&nbsp;those kids</strong>. You might as&nbsp;well make the best of&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>His son Jack decided to&nbsp;stay out of&nbsp;the spotlight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/131/074/38200958649efb27e0b1eccfda.jpg><p>KCS/East News</p><p>Growing up&nbsp;with parents as&nbsp;famous as&nbsp;Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, Jack, and Lily-Rose had a&nbsp;childhood that was anything but ordinary. But Vanessa, their mom, did her best to&nbsp;keep them out of&nbsp;the media circus. She didn’t want to&nbsp;push them into the spotlight against their will. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>: “For my&nbsp;children&nbsp;I secretly choose France. Only, in&nbsp;the south of&nbsp;France you can live much more anonymously.”</p><p>Lily-Rose decided to&nbsp;embrace the family tradition and went for an&nbsp;acting career, so&nbsp;she stayed in&nbsp;the spotlight. But Jack took a&nbsp;different route. However, he&nbsp;also proved his artistic flair in&nbsp;other ways, by&nbsp;forming his own band and showing a&nbsp;keen interest in&nbsp;drawing. Despite having a&nbsp;natural talent for the arts, Jack has no&nbsp;intention of&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;actor, according to&nbsp;his proud father, Johnny Depp.</p><p>“My&nbsp;boy Jack has always been a&nbsp;very talented draftsman. He&nbsp;draws really super-well. He&nbsp;also plays music very well. He’s got a&nbsp;good feel for that. Aside from school plays and things, he&nbsp;hasn’t shown any desire to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor,” Johnny <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remarked</a>.</p><p>Interestingly, Jack’s full name, John Jack Christopher Depp III, pays homage to&nbsp;both his father and grandfather. What’s even more fascinating is&nbsp;that the commonly used name “Jack” coincides with one of&nbsp;Johnny Depp’s most iconic film characters, Captain Jack Sparrow, adding a&nbsp;touch of&nbsp;cinematic charm to&nbsp;his name.</p><p><h2>Johnny shares a&nbsp;really close bond with his son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f14/d94/c998215d14b96ad346e1d5d567.jpg><p>PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP/East News</p><p>Johnny Depp and his son Jack might not share the same career goals, but they have a&nbsp;strong bond and some similarities in&nbsp;their personalities. Johnny has shared some interesting stories about Jack. One <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>funny story</a> was about Jack learning to&nbsp;drive at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;15. Like any teenager, he&nbsp;had his share of&nbsp;hilarious and relatable experiences while getting behind the wheel. “He&nbsp;has my&nbsp;instincts—my boy, and&nbsp;uh, he’s crashed about five golf carts.”</p><p>Additionally, during Johnny’s challenging legal battle with his ex-wife, Amber Heard, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about how the trial affected his children. Johnny wanted to&nbsp;shield them from the trial’s negative consequences, emphasizing how important it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;protect them.</p><p>Amid his heartfelt speech about shielding his children from the trial’s fallout, Johnny also shared a&nbsp;proud and humorous moment. He&nbsp;recalled the time when Jack excitedly told him that he&nbsp;was starting his own band and revealed the band’s name, to&nbsp;which Johnny <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>went</a> like: “<strong>We&nbsp;don’t need a&nbsp;paternity test. That’s my&nbsp;kid.</strong>”</p><p><h2>Fans have pointed out that Johnny and his son Jack don’t look alike.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af9/655/5145325da6969342ca3f6a3955.jpg><p>Chassery+Pecquenard/KCS/East News</p><p>While Johnny’s son shares his father’s interests, there was a&nbsp;point when fans didn’t see much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;physical resemblance between the two. About three years ago, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;news outlet</a> published an&nbsp;article featuring famous father-son duos who supposedly looked alike, and Johnny and Jack were among them.</p><p>However, when fans saw the side-by-side photo of&nbsp;Jack and his father, they had a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;say. Many comments expressed how different the two looked, “I&nbsp;wouldn’t know that was his son”, one user wrote, with some going as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;to&nbsp;say that Jack resembled actor Jack Black more than his own dad.</p><p>The same thing happened when the same news outlet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a> a&nbsp;rare sighting of&nbsp;Johnny’s son who supposedly looked like him. One Facebook user commented with a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young Johnny and remarked: <strong>“Johnny at&nbsp;his son’s age now...no resemblance!!!”</strong>, and similar comments like, “He&nbsp;looks absolutely NOTHING like him.”</p><p>However, despite any physical differences, there’s no&nbsp;denying that they are family and share a&nbsp;close bond. In&nbsp;this family dynamic, Jack and his sister, Lily-Rose, also maintain a&nbsp;strong relationship and close brotherhood bond. <strong>“My&nbsp;brother and&nbsp;I are super close, so&nbsp;it’s been cool to&nbsp;fight over what’s in&nbsp;the fridge again or&nbsp;whatever,”</strong><i><strong> </strong></i>Lily-Rose <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Johnny Depp has captured the hearts of&nbsp;many, and it’s not just because of&nbsp;his incredible talent or&nbsp;his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;great dad. The actor has also shown his caring side on&nbsp;numerous occasions, like when he&nbsp;dressed up&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=#>Jack Sparrow</a> to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;sick fan’s day.</p><p>Preview photo credit PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA/AFP/East News<span>, </span>KCS/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2mu8%2BlnGarka56q7vHp6WyZZSavbG%2FjKymp2WYlsBuus5mqZ6rlaKvra3NnJxmr5mptW60yKZkcWllbIB1ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpeople-say-johnny-depps-son-has-no-resemblance-with-him-815734.html&text=People%20Say%20Johnny%20Depps%20Son%20Has%20No%20Resemblance%20With%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeople-say-johnny-depps-son-has-no-resemblance-with-him-815734.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-say-johnny-depps-son-has-no-resemblance-with-him-815734.html&title=People%20Say%20Johnny%20Depps%20Son%20Has%20No%20Resemblance%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpeople-say-johnny-depps-son-has-no-resemblance-with-him-815734.html&title=People%20Say%20Johnny%20Depps%20Son%20Has%20No%20Resemblance%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpeople-say-johnny-depps-son-has-no-resemblance-with-him-815734.html&title=People%20Say%20Johnny%20Depps%20Son%20Has%20No%20Resemblance%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeople-say-johnny-depps-son-has-no-resemblance-with-him-815734.html&description=People%20Say%20Johnny%20Depps%20Son%20Has%20No%20Resemblance%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./photo-day-helen-mirren.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photo of the Day: Helen Mirren, an Advocate for Art">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./5623-petitions-sack-richard-littlejohn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Online petition | YouGov">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
