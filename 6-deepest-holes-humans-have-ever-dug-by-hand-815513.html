It&nbsp;may have the title of&nbsp;the deepest hand-dug well in&nbsp;the world, but at&nbsp;first sight, it’s just a&nbsp;small covered well you wouldn’t even assume that it’s there. It’s located somewhere close to&nbsp;Brighton and Hove, <a href=# title=England data-link=tag>England</a>.</p><p>Despite its inconspicuous appearance, it’s as&nbsp;deep as&nbsp;the Empire State Building is&nbsp;tall&nbsp;— 1,280 feet straight down into the dark, wet ground. Hey, toss in&nbsp;a&nbsp;penny and make a&nbsp;wish. Wait it’s not a&nbsp;wishing well. Never mind.</p><p>In&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 19th century, one powerful corporation wanted to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;new workhouse in&nbsp;the area that’s today known as&nbsp;Elm Grove [Brighton]. They decided to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;it&nbsp;an&nbsp;industrial school for juveniles as&nbsp;well. It&nbsp;was established for those whose parents were living in&nbsp;the local workhouse and the aim was to&nbsp;teach the youth “the habits of&nbsp;industry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e4b/6f3/d97f735b08938ce597803914c4.png><p>The corporation wanted to&nbsp;provide water for their new institution, so&nbsp;they dug a&nbsp;new well. It&nbsp;was too expensive to&nbsp;bring piped water in&nbsp;from the nearby waterworks. They first wanted to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;6-feet-wide brick-lined well down to&nbsp;about 400&nbsp;feet. That’s where they expected to&nbsp;find the subterranean water table.</p><p>They were digging for 2&nbsp;years, and the shaft went past those depths, but they still didn’t find any water. They thought they somehow missed the water source, so&nbsp;they started digging horizontally in&nbsp;4&nbsp;different ways. Even after many hours of&nbsp;work and multiple tunnels in&nbsp;different directions... Still nothing.</p><p>For the next two years, they didn’t stop digging. Workers would descend rickety ladders hundreds of&nbsp;feet below the surface, illuminated just by&nbsp;the light of&nbsp;candles. They only used hand tools to&nbsp;load their buckets with soil and pass them up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the surface. Then they would use bricks other workers would send down from above to&nbsp;line the narrow interior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7c3/46f/5158e259f2b51cd2be5e8787d6.png><p>The heat down there was intense. They were able to&nbsp;breathe thanks to&nbsp;steam engines that would pump air through pipes down below. After 4&nbsp;years of&nbsp;digging, they got to&nbsp;a&nbsp;depth of&nbsp;1,285&nbsp;feet.&nbsp;850 feet of&nbsp;that was below sea level. At&nbsp;that point, the water finally broke through the surface. But as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was coming&nbsp;up, the workers were trying to&nbsp;escape&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;took them 45&nbsp;minutes to&nbsp;scramble up&nbsp;such a&nbsp;deep shaft.</p><p>It&nbsp;was expensive, and the company put enormous effort into this well. And they used it&nbsp;for just four years. They abandoned the well in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;some other, more practical one. A&nbsp;2-foot flint and brick wall is&nbsp;surrounding Woodingdean Water Well now. There’s also a&nbsp;metal lid covering its top, so&nbsp;people wouldn’t fall. It&nbsp;would certainly feel like a&nbsp;journey to&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the Earth, don’t you think?</p><p>It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;research team 20&nbsp;years to&nbsp;drill down the Kola Superdeep Borehole. This one is&nbsp;over 40,000 feet [40,230&nbsp;feet] deep. And despite getting so&nbsp;deep, they never actually reached the mantle. The drill bit was just around ⅓ of&nbsp;the total way through the crust to&nbsp;the mantle. The heat was insane which made their work extra hard. Also, their drill got stuck in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock, so&nbsp;the whole project was finally abandoned in&nbsp;1989.</p><p>The Kola Peninsula is&nbsp;located deep in&nbsp;the Arctic Circle. Forests, lakes, snow, and mysterious mists, kind of&nbsp;turn this area into a&nbsp;scene from a&nbsp;fairy tale. But in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;one crumbling building there, you can see a&nbsp;heavy, rusty metal cap. It’s embedded in&nbsp;the concrete floor as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;secured by&nbsp;a&nbsp;thick, rusty ring of&nbsp;metal bolts. And that’s the deepest artificial point on&nbsp;our planet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a3d/e18/cb41305733aa901e5368b31f36.png><p>Bingham Canyon Mine near Salt Lake City, Utah is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cool one too. More people know it&nbsp;as&nbsp;Kennecott Copper Mine. This mine spans 3&nbsp;square miles and produces more copper than all other mines have in&nbsp;our world’s history. It&nbsp;was opened at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century. It’s owned by&nbsp;large multinational corporation [Rio Tinto] at&nbsp;the moment.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;2010, they even declared they’d like to&nbsp;dig the mine further and deepen it&nbsp;for another 300&nbsp;feet. Bingham Canyon Mine has so&nbsp;many roads. If&nbsp;you could stretch them out into one large road, it&nbsp;could go&nbsp;from Salt Lake City all the way to&nbsp;Denver. There was a&nbsp;massive landslide in&nbsp;April 2013 in&nbsp;this area&nbsp;— so&nbsp;strong it&nbsp;even caused its own earthquakes. This is&nbsp;the world’s deepest open-pit mine [0.6&nbsp;miles], so&nbsp;deep astronauts can see it&nbsp;from orbit.</p><p>Humans first started digging toward the planet’s mantle in&nbsp;the 1960s. That’s when American scientists began with something they named “Project Mohole”. The project got its name after a&nbsp;man [Andrija Mohorovicic] who found the boundary between the Earth’s mantle and crust. The team didn’t drill on&nbsp;land, but on&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat in&nbsp;the ocean. The crust is&nbsp;actually thinner on&nbsp;the ocean floor, although the difficult part is&nbsp;that the crust is&nbsp;the thinnest in&nbsp;areas where the ocean is&nbsp;deepest. Go&nbsp;figure. The researchers were drilling next to&nbsp;the island of&nbsp;Guadalupe, which is&nbsp;off the west coast of&nbsp;Mexico.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cdb/34b/839bc15209b3df224049edea50.png><p>There’s a&nbsp;pit of&nbsp;impressive size and an&nbsp;amazing background story. One man [Bapurao Tajne] in&nbsp;a&nbsp;drought-ridden part of&nbsp;India [state of&nbsp;Maharashtra] has really done the impossible&nbsp;— he&nbsp;dug a&nbsp;well in&nbsp;only 40&nbsp;days. His wife wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;draw water from a&nbsp;well that was in&nbsp;the village because of&nbsp;the caste they belong&nbsp;to. A&nbsp;man decided to&nbsp;dig a&nbsp;well by&nbsp;himself and give a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;water both to&nbsp;his family and the community.</p><p>No&nbsp;one believed it&nbsp;was possible, but he&nbsp;took his shovel and kept digging day after day, before going to&nbsp;work every morning, and later in&nbsp;the evening after he&nbsp;would finish the work.&nbsp;40&nbsp;days later, he&nbsp;finally got to&nbsp;the water and proved that some people can sometimes truly stretch their mental and physical limits to&nbsp;achieve what’s impossible.</p><p>Imagine how difficult it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;dig a&nbsp;mine by&nbsp;hand. And we’re talking about a&nbsp;really big hole mine. They would mine diamonds without any machinery. You can find such a&nbsp;case in&nbsp;<a href=# title="South Africa" data-link=tag>South Africa</a> in&nbsp;the province of&nbsp;Kimberley. A&nbsp;geological pipe there was formed after a&nbsp;breakthrough of&nbsp;gasses in&nbsp;the crust of&nbsp;our planet. The pipe was named Kimberlite after the location, just like others in&nbsp;that area. It’s in&nbsp;the shape of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty large carrot. You can see its upper conical part that narrows as&nbsp;it&nbsp;goes deeper, turning into a&nbsp;vein in&nbsp;the end.&nbsp;1870 was the time when the diamond fever began in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;Kimberley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7f4/41a/7c2e6d5a15a46542d208040d46.png><p>Nearly&nbsp;50,000 people were mining and extracting more than 20&nbsp;million tons of&nbsp;soil using only their picks and shovels. The development area was close to&nbsp;2&nbsp;million square feet [1,829,000 square feet]. They dug up&nbsp;to&nbsp;787 feet from 1871 to&nbsp;1914 and extracted enormous amounts of&nbsp;diamonds, worth more than a&nbsp;billion dollars. This mine has become an&nbsp;artificial lake. Today it’s the most picturesque landmark in&nbsp;this province.</p><p>Darvaza crater is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the world’s most unique spots you can find. It’s a&nbsp;burning hole people actually made more than 40&nbsp;years ago. This gaping crater opened up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the desert of&nbsp;Turkmenistan. It&nbsp;was most likely a&nbsp;consequence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;drilling mishap.</p><p>Geologists then set it&nbsp;on&nbsp;fire on&nbsp;purpose. They were afraid all those noxious gases would have a&nbsp;negative impact on&nbsp;the environment, so&nbsp;they wanted to&nbsp;burn them off. They also wanted to&nbsp;prevent the spread of&nbsp;methane gas after the ground below the drilling rig collapsed into a&nbsp;cavern.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1c0/aee/0d850e5403acd93d81ede8e19b.png><p>So, now we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;98-feet deep hole [diameter of&nbsp;226&nbsp;feet]. They thought the crater would burn only for a&nbsp;week or&nbsp;so. Oops! But they were wrong. Thing&nbsp;is, the crater’s been burning for over 40&nbsp;years now.</p><p>Actually, it’s not that bad. The hole on&nbsp;fire eventually turned into a&nbsp;quite popular spot that attracts many tourists. This site looks like the portal to&nbsp;the Earth’s core! Hey, maybe you have some marshmallows we&nbsp;can roast?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZINusMSep56rpGK1sLjErGShrZ2Wu7R5x5qtnmWVq7KzecOunmaaqWK1orrDZm9qbWVmgHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f6-deepest-holes-humans-have-ever-dug-by-hand-815513.html&text=6%20Deepest%20Holes%20Humans%20Have%20Ever%20Dug%20by%20Hand&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f6-deepest-holes-humans-have-ever-dug-by-hand-815513.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f6-deepest-holes-humans-have-ever-dug-by-hand-815513.html&title=6%20Deepest%20Holes%20Humans%20Have%20Ever%20Dug%20by%20Hand" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f6-deepest-holes-humans-have-ever-dug-by-hand-815513.html&title=6%20Deepest%20Holes%20Humans%20Have%20Ever%20Dug%20by%20Hand" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f6-deepest-holes-humans-have-ever-dug-by-hand-815513.html&title=6%20Deepest%20Holes%20Humans%20Have%20Ever%20Dug%20by%20Hand" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f6-deepest-holes-humans-have-ever-dug-by-hand-815513.html&description=6%20Deepest%20Holes%20Humans%20Have%20Ever%20Dug%20by%20Hand" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./german-philosophers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 German philosophers you need to know">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-25-most-beautiful-female-celebs-according-to-ordinary-people-808584.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="25 Female Celebs That Ordinary People Think Are Drop-Dead Gorgeous">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
