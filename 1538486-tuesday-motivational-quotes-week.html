Try doing something nice for someone, whether a kind gesture or a positive remark.</li><li>Taking positive action is the secret sauce to unlocking your true potential and getting unstuck.</li><li>Tuesday morning is a time to reflect upon the words you use; are they <a href=#>positive-filled words</a> or complaining words; are they words that inspire others and are a positive influence; you choose your words and make them count.</li><li>Work and youâ€™ll get what you need; work harder and get what you want.</li><li>If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us.</li><li>Winners embrace hard work.

Don't wish it were easier; wish you were better.</li><li>Don't let the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning.</li><li>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.</li><li>When you do the right thing, you get the feeling of peace and serenity associated with it. Do it again and again.</li><li>A single day is enough to make us a little larger or, another time, a little smaller.</li><li>The only thing that can transform a regular day into a happy one is surrounding ourselves with positive people and things, allowing us to see the brighter side of life and find the wonder and excitement that we deserve.</li><li>What are you planting in your mind this Tuesday - results or weeds?</li><li>Donâ€™t hold grudges; they will ruin your Tuesday. Forgiving helps you more than it helps others.</li><li>Sometimes Tuesday feels like you will never get to be where you want to be, but donâ€™t give up. Small actions every day do make a difference!</li><li>Itâ€™s another morning to remind yourself that you can do great things.</li><li>Now you only have four to go. Monday is done.
