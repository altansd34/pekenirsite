It's like starting over, waking up for a new day, when our old problems can be left behind for new aspirations.</li><li>The object of a New Year is not that we should have a New Year. It is that we should have a new soul.</li><li>You may have a fresh start any moment you choose, for what we call 'failure' is not falling but staying down.</li><li>Year’s end is neither an end nor a beginning but a going on, with all the wisdom that experience can instil in us.</li><li>If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do? All our dreams can come true if we dare to pursue them.</li><li>You are imperfectly perfect and beautifully made: no matter what happens, there's nothing to regret because every little detail of your life has led up to this perfect moment.</li><li>Every ending is a new beginning. Through the grace of God, we can always start again.</li><li>Always strive for more because that's what life is about - it's an ongoing process, not an event! A man cannot say that he has lived until he has finished what he was sent into this world to do.</li><li>The end of a year might seem bittersweet, but it is a new start that brings clarity.</li><li>Keep on beginning and failing. Each time you fail, start all over again, and you will grow stronger until you have accomplished a purpose – not the one you began with, perhaps, but one you'll be glad to remember.</li><li>You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.</li><li>Be grateful to God, every year you live.</li><li>It's always possible to become who you want to be. I hope you live a life you're proud of, and if you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start over.</li><li>Every day is a new beginning. Treat it that way. Stay away from what might have been, and look at what can be.</li><li>It's a wise man who understands that every day is a new beginning because, boy, how many mistakes do you make in a day? I don't know about you, but I make plenty. You can't turn the clock back, so you must look ahead.</li><li>Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year.</li><li>Life doesn't stop. Life moves on whether you are ready or not. New things happen daily, demand your attention, or you will miss out on the best life opportunities.</li><li>Yesterday is gone; tomorrow hasn't arrived yet; today is here, and now is up to you.</li><li>Close the chapter of last year with a smile and reflection. Allow excitement and joy to bring in your new tomorrow.</li><li>Do not wait until the conditions are perfect to begin. Beginnings make the conditions perfect.</li><li>With the end of the year, it's time to think of new possibilities for the future.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/63db808120c4be4b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ have a great weekend message ideas to send to your colleagues</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Share your outstanding story with our editors!

Your certification is in your degree. You will consider it because of the price tags of the beautiful life. Consider it as your price tag to alter the planet.</li><li>Remember how many people would love to take your place when you think about giving up. Good things come to those who work hard enough.</li><li>You don't attend university; therefore, you'll be able to punch a clock. You attend university; consequently, you'll be able to be in an exceedingly position to create a distinction.</li><li>I think of how you've learned. You're reading at a higher grade level, and you can speak with a confidence you didn't possess in August. You're not that same kid I met; you're different, which simultaneously breaks my heart and comforts me.</li><li>With this year ending, you may feel overwhelmed, frustrated or even sad. Don't let your emotions control you and hold you back from being successful.

We wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavours; you will be great!</li><li>The end of the school year is not only an opportunity to close one chapter and start another. It's also a time for reflection. Take some time before summer break to reflect on all that has happened this past year!</li><li>As this term ends, I want to thank every student for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. It was a pleasure teaching you all, have a fantastic summer!</li><li>Enjoy these final moments of your last day of classes. If you want to play, then practice. If you're going to win, then practice harder.</li><li>Say goodbye to 2022. You did it! Good luck in the future as you take steps towards achieving whatever goals or aspirations come next.</li><li>Be active, read more often, see the good, forgive soon, and send good text messages. Welcome this New Year with a happy and good soul. Happy New Year, dear students.</li><li>Hope this New Year makes all your dreams come true and your wishes fulfilled.

Mine is to check all bookmarks I added to my browser in 2023.</li><li>I was going to resolve never to be late again this New Year, but I didn't wake up until January 2nd.</li><li>Stop trying to press rewind. It’s life, not a movie.</li><li>New Year is a time to start afresh, all over again, but you realize things are too complicated and can't begin to. Happy New Year!</li><li>New Year's day is the accepted time to make regular annual good resolutions. Next week you can begin paving hell with them as usual.</li><li>The funniest part of a New Year is making new resolutions. I think you have one too. Let me know your answer, and I'll try not to laugh as I did the last year.</li><li>If you have been on this earth for more than a few years, chances are high that you will need to live longer to complete all those resolutions.</li><li>If it makes you feel better, keep telling yourself: this year, I will. It's like yelling fire in a crowded theatre. You'll get out before it becomes dangerous.</li><li>Before I pass out after taking my favourite drink on the New Year, I want to send you my New Year's wishes. May your mind return to factory settings. Happy New Year.</li><li>I am very sorry for annoying you throughout the year. Please allow me to trouble you again in the upcoming New Year!</li><li>An optimist stays up until midnight to see the new year in. A pessimist stays up to make sure the old year leaves.</li><li>When you were young, you wanted to stay up all night to celebrate the New Year, and now you are old, and all you want is to sleep.</li><li>A New Year doesn't come to change your life. It reminds you that one more year has gone, and you're still the same useless moron who thinks he can make his resolutions come true!</li><li>May this New Year bring you more problems, tears, and pains. Don't get me wrong. I want you to be a stronger person.</li><li>My prayer for 2023 is a fat bank account and a thin body. Please don't mix up these like you did this year.</li><li>Say your thanks before 2022 ends because when 2023 rolls around, all we'll hear from people is I told myself I would do that.</li><li>I hope growing up is not included in your resolution this year. Let's live like the old ones, and we can grow up in some other years. Happy New Year 2022, partner!</li><li>My New Year's resolution is to stop hanging out with people who ask me about my recent year's resolutions.</li><li>New Years are like restart buttons. You think you can push the button and start things all over again but then realize your life is too messed up to be restarted fresh!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cd28a2e54dcdf6a1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50 lovely flower quotes to brighten up your mood for spring</span></p></a><h2>Sad end-of-year quotes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a0ab6319b56cc3f1.jpg><p class=align-left>For everyone starting a <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/quotes-messages/1498084-100-positive-chapter-quotes-turn-a-leaf/ href=#>new chapter</a> in their lives, it's always difficult to say goodbye.
