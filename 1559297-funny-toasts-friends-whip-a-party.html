He must be overjoyed that she is now content to spend their date nights in jammies and a ponytail.</li><li>If the ocean was beer and I was a duck, I would swim to the bottom and drink myself up. But the ocean's not beer, and I'm not a duck, so let's drink these pints and get messed up.</li><li>Marriage is an attempt to solve problems together which you didn't even have when you were alone.</li><li>My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.</li><li>Today, we are gathered here to witness a magical, life-changing event…my speech. The wedding wasn't so bad either!</li><li>Life is a waste of time, and time is a waste of life. So let's get wasted all of the time and have the time of our life.</li><li>We can all agree that it's been a beautiful day. Unfortunately, that ends here with my speech!</li><li>Being a good husband is like being a stand-up comic. You need ten years before you can call yourself a beginner.</li><li>God in goodness sent us grapes to cheer, both great and small. Little fools drink too much, and great fools not at all.</li><li>May you never lie, cheat, or drink. But if you must lie, lie with each other. And if you must cheat, cheat death. And if you must drink, drink with us. Cheers to the newlyweds!</li><li>I wish you a lot of happiness, but that there is always room for new ones. More money, but also so that there is room in the wallet for the future. To make your friends treasure you, women love you, and your bosses appreciate you!</li><li>Congratulations, buddy! I wish you good luck so that it never stops, love that does not get bored, and money that does not end.</li><li>My friend, Happy Holidays! Let the green light shine on you everywhere in life, and the red one will light up only in order to warn you in time.
