Jean said Michael committed adultery with Dr Ian Smith, popularly known for hosting a healthy talk show, <i>The Doctors</i>. She also said Strahan had stayed in Ian Smith's one-bedroom apartment.</p><p class=align-left>In 2012, the NFL star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denied being gay</a> in an interview with Bryant Gumbel on HBO's <i>Real Sports</i>. He stated:</p>I think early on, when you're reading all these things in the paper that aren't true â€” I'm not an adulterer. I'm not gay. I mean, I didn't beat anybody.<p class=align-left>Ian Smith also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denied being</a> in a romantic relationship with Michael. He said he was married and couldn't have a relationship with Strahan.</p><p class=align-left>The other factor contributing to the questions about Michael Strahan's sexuality is his public support of the LGBTQ+ community. For instance, he supported Human Rights Campaigns for New Yorkers for Marriage Equality. Additionally, he advocated for gay inclusion in the National Football League. While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speaking to</a> The Hollywood Reporter in 2013, the <a href=#>football analyst</a> said he wished there would be a gay player in the league.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b64a8b52d52e5d05.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kyle Baryâ€™s biography: age, height, family, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><h3>History of Michael Strahan's relationships</h3><p class=align-left>The NFL star has been married twice, engaged once and dated several women. Here is a closer look at the TV personality's romantic life and the women he has been linked with.</p><h4>Wanda Hutchins (1992-1996)</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ebf601642b9b72ff.jpg><p class=align-left>Wanda was the first wife of a TV reality star. She is an <a href=#>American businesswoman</a> who owns Wondaful Home Designs. The two met in Germany at a match. They started dating in 1990 and tied the knot after two years.</p><p class=align-left>The couple welcomed their daughter Tanita Strahan in 1992 and their son, Michael Antony Jr, in 1995. However, their marriage did not last long, as they divorced in 1996. <a href=#>Wanda stated</a> that getting into marriage at a young age was the reason behind their failed marriage. The two remain friends while co-parenting their children. They ended their marriage amicably.</p><h4>Jean Muggli (1999-2006)</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b64a8b52d52e5d05.png><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>TV personality</a> married his second wife, Jean Muggli, in 1999, three years after divorcing Wanda Hutchins. The duo first met at a spa.

Strahan contemplated filing for divorce first, but Jean was the first to reach the courts. Michael discovered that Jean had withdrawn $3.3 million from his bank account, and when he confronted her about it, it resulted in chaos.</p><p class=align-left>On the other hand, Jean accused him of being abusive, adulterer and neglectful. The NFL star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denied the allegations</a>, citing,</p>I would never physically or psychologically harm any of my loved ones, especially my wife. That's simply not the man I am. I will continue to respect Jean's privacy and not contribute to a public spectacle of a highly private matter.<p class=align-left>Jean received $15 million as a divorce settlement and $18,000 monthly child support following the divorce. Strahan appealed the ruling in March 2007, and therefore, the court ordered the two to auction their Montclair, New Jersey mansion and the monies received to be shared equally between them. The villa had a market value of $3.6 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/62d35e13a9a2d188.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Sanaa Lathan have a husband?
