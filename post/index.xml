Now, there are 11 official languages in South Africa, nine of which are African languages from the Bantu family.

People might often associate Keanu with short hair because of&amp;nbsp;the success of&amp;nbsp;movies such as&amp;nbsp;Speed and The Matrix.

Although doing it&amp;nbsp;occasionally is&amp;nbsp;relatively harmless, repeatedly holding in&amp;nbsp;your pee may not be&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;safe as&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;seems. Besides causing temporary discomfort, there are several reasons to&amp;nbsp;break this habit once and for all.
1. It&amp;nbsp;might damage your kidneys.
Although occasionally holding your pee doesn’t pose serious health risks, some people might want to&amp;nbsp;avoid doing&amp;nbsp;so. For example, keeping your urine for a&amp;nbsp;long time might make you vulnerable to&amp;nbsp;infections, especially if&amp;nbsp;you have kidney conditions.</description></item><item><title>'American Idol' Season 22 Decides the Top 12 Singers</title><link>/american-idol-season-22-decides-the-top-12-singers.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/american-idol-season-22-decides-the-top-12-singers.html</guid><description>TALENTRECAP.COM Singing American Idol

1. Who Framed Roger Rabbit
In&amp;nbsp;the detective drama Who Framed Roger Rabbit, there’s a&amp;nbsp;scene where a&amp;nbsp;character is&amp;nbsp;reading the newspaper, and it&amp;nbsp;shows a&amp;nbsp;photograph of&amp;nbsp;Jessica Rabbit. However, we&amp;nbsp;can see that she looks somewhat different from how she appears later on&amp;nbsp;screen. This is&amp;nbsp;probably because the scene was edited with an&amp;nbsp;early stage version of&amp;nbsp;the character design that differs from the iconic Jessica we&amp;nbsp;all remember.</description></item><item><title>13 Stars Who Admit Being Confused With Other Celebs by Fans</title><link>/13-stars-who-admit-being-confused-with-other-celebs-by-fans-809066.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/13-stars-who-admit-being-confused-with-other-celebs-by-fans-809066.html</guid><description>In&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;world of&amp;nbsp;over 7&amp;nbsp;billion individuals, each with their own unique features and quirks, it’s fascinating to&amp;nbsp;consider the odds of&amp;nbsp;encountering someone who shares your face.

It’s not just about our appearance, but also about how we&amp;nbsp;treat our health, our family, our money, and other things. What was significant in&amp;nbsp;our 20’s, becomes not such a&amp;nbsp;big priority when we&amp;nbsp;turn&amp;nbsp;30, and vice versa.

Some bridal gowns, however, have an&amp;nbsp;even deeper meaning for the ladies wearing them. Many brides, including celebrities, want their dresses to&amp;nbsp;bring them good luck and happiness, and they try to&amp;nbsp;include some little sentimental details in&amp;nbsp;their wedding outfits, or&amp;nbsp;just make them differ from other gowns in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;special way.

For example, almost every jacket Michael Jackson wore had an&amp;nbsp;armband on&amp;nbsp;the right sleeve, and some of&amp;nbsp;his jackets also had “777” sewn onto them.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side are fascinated with Michael Jackson`s wardrobe, and we`re ready to&amp;nbsp;reveal some of&amp;nbsp;the secrets behind his costumes!

However, before the 19th century, this was unthinkable. What we&amp;nbsp;now know as&amp;nbsp;the bathroom appeared in&amp;nbsp;Europe at&amp;nbsp;the end of&amp;nbsp;the 1800s when running water became widespread in&amp;nbsp;the home. Previously, there were only public bathrooms, where it&amp;nbsp;was common to&amp;nbsp;play and even engage in&amp;nbsp;conversation while performing intimate needs. We&amp;nbsp;can’t imagine any of&amp;nbsp;that in&amp;nbsp;our time.
Bright Side researched some facts about ancient bathrooms and how they evolved from large gathering places to&amp;nbsp;smaller, more personal venues.</description></item><item><title>12 Online Conversations That Could Only Happen With Parents</title><link>/12-online-conversations-that-could-only-happen-with-parents-796837.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/12-online-conversations-that-could-only-happen-with-parents-796837.html</guid><description>It&amp;nbsp;often seems like parents and children involuntarily try to&amp;nbsp;beat each other in&amp;nbsp;terms of&amp;nbsp;sarcastic remarks and resourcefulness. And then the question arises about whether the children have learned this from their moms and dads, or&amp;nbsp;whether it’s the parents who have to&amp;nbsp;keep up&amp;nbsp;with their growing children and adapt to&amp;nbsp;their communication style.
However, all of&amp;nbsp;these conversations have unique and hilarious stories behind them.
