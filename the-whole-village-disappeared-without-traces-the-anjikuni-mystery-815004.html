The cold penetrates his bones. His legs are almost knee-deep in&nbsp;snow. Experienced hunter Joe Labelle makes his way through the <a href=# title=forest data-link=tag>forest</a>, covering his face from the headwind. Any other person would have already fallen and screamed in&nbsp;despair, but not Joe Labelle. He&nbsp;can survive in&nbsp;any circumstances and always knows what to&nbsp;do. Right now, he’s heading to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the villages in&nbsp;the far north of&nbsp;Canada.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/055/02a/541b6a5ee6a9620e3744786865.png><p>This small settlement is&nbsp;located on&nbsp;Lake Anjikuni (an-jee-KUni). The inhabitants of&nbsp;this village are Inuit, indigenous people of&nbsp;North America. Joe hasn’t eaten or&nbsp;drunk for a&nbsp;long time. He&nbsp;needs good sleep and a&nbsp;hot meal, which he&nbsp;hopes to&nbsp;get from the hospitable Inuits. Through trees and a&nbsp;white haze, he&nbsp;notices the silhouettes of&nbsp;tents. <a href=# title=Smoke data-link=tag>Smoke</a> is&nbsp;coming from some houses. Joe will probably get there in&nbsp;time for lunch.</p><p>He&nbsp;reaches the village, and, at&nbsp;this moment, the wind calms down. The blizzard has ended. The hunter speeds up&nbsp;and goes toward the village located along the frozen lake. It’s strange, but there are no&nbsp;locals anywhere. Probably, everyone is&nbsp;sitting in&nbsp;their houses, waiting out the blizzard. “Hello?” Joe says loudly but gets no&nbsp;response. Great! Smoke is&nbsp;coming out of&nbsp;this tent. Joe knocks on&nbsp;the wall, but no&nbsp;one opens&nbsp;it.</p><p>He&nbsp;knocks a&nbsp;few more times and goes inside. The little tent is&nbsp;empty. All things are in&nbsp;their places. There’s a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;cloth with needles and thread on&nbsp;the table. Firewood is&nbsp;smoldering in&nbsp;the fireplace. It&nbsp;seems that people have just left this place. Joe goes into the next tent and sees the same picture. All things are in&nbsp;their places, but there are no&nbsp;people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3ab/985/640f385ae39ac36e4c50f30c90.png><p>Joe walks past the tents and sees a&nbsp;pit where a&nbsp;bonfire once burned. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rope above&nbsp;it, with the <a href=# title=meat data-link=tag>meat</a> that the Inuit were cooking hanging on&nbsp;it. For some reason, they didn’t eat&nbsp;it. Lake Anjikuni is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chain of&nbsp;waterways. Here, the Inuits fished and traded various goods. Usually, there are many people here, but now something has forced them to&nbsp;leave their homes.</p><p>Why did they leave their things behind, and where did they&nbsp;go? There are no&nbsp;tracks around the village. All the sleds are in&nbsp;place. The Inuits have even left their dogs here. And dogs help them to&nbsp;hunt and ride sleighs. No&nbsp;one will leave warm clothes and dogs here when moving away, especially in&nbsp;severe weather. Joe Labelle knows all this, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;concludes that something terrible has happened here. His body is&nbsp;shaking, not from the cold but from fear. After going around the entire settlement, he&nbsp;finds not a&nbsp;single soul.</p><p>Terrified, he&nbsp;leaves the village, heads for the nearest telegraph pole, and sends a&nbsp;message to&nbsp;the police. After a&nbsp;while, more and more people arrive. The police are trying to&nbsp;find traces of&nbsp;missing people and figure out what has happened, but there’s nothing. Near the village, they find an&nbsp;empty grave. During the ceremony, the Inuits placed stones around the burial site. The rocks around the open pit lie untouched, which means it&nbsp;wasn’t an&nbsp;animal that dug it&nbsp;up. But who or&nbsp;what needed&nbsp;it?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/98b/c81/0db8ac5088ab0804013072defa.png><p>About 30&nbsp;people lived in&nbsp;the village. And they’re all gone. Local residents from neighboring villages can’t help since they have no&nbsp;idea what has happened. The only thing that the police have noticed is&nbsp;unusual blue lights. In&nbsp;this area, the northern lights are a&nbsp;common phenomenon. People living here regularly see a&nbsp;glow in&nbsp;the starry <a href=# title=sky data-link=tag>sky</a>. But the police have seen something else&nbsp;— pulsing blue lights. Also, other hunters have witnessed something similar. They say that some strange things were flying in&nbsp;the sky.</p><p>This all happened in&nbsp;1930. It’s been almost 90&nbsp;years since the disappearance of&nbsp;the village, and people have created a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;theories. The most popular of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;an&nbsp;attack of&nbsp;an&nbsp;extraterrestrial civilization. According to&nbsp;this theory, the blue lights in&nbsp;the sky that the locals and the police saw were spaceships. Some believe that one ominous night, these ships flew to&nbsp;the settlement and took away all the people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/570/1db/6633535fb1bcd2e99eb206a1a4.png><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;these sci-fi versions, there were also more realistic ones. Internet users have found out that Joe Labelle didn’t have a&nbsp;hunting license. Maybe he&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;professional and made it&nbsp;all&nbsp;up. But at&nbsp;that time, many hunters didn’t have a&nbsp;license, so&nbsp;Joe’s words may be&nbsp;true. But if&nbsp;we&nbsp;try to&nbsp;find out where all this information came from, we’ll see that the primary sources were books and some newspaper articles from the 30s. But none of&nbsp;them can confirm that the mysterious story of&nbsp;Lake Anjikuni is&nbsp;true. Perhaps, this entire story was made&nbsp;up.</p><p>Now, let’s leave the snows of&nbsp;Canada and head for the hot plains of&nbsp;<a href=# title=India data-link=tag>India</a>. In&nbsp;this big country, there’s one sinister village where people also disappeared without a&nbsp;trace. This happened in&nbsp;the first half of&nbsp;the 19th century. Still, locals avoid this place even now because they believe that invisible evil forces live there. Let’s check and find out what happened to&nbsp;the village of&nbsp;Kuldhara (Cool-DA-ra).</p><p>It’s located in&nbsp;the district of&nbsp;Rajasthan. To&nbsp;get there, you can use a&nbsp;taxi to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the nearest village or&nbsp;city. The village is&nbsp;located far from other settlements. It&nbsp;looks deserted. There are only ruins. It&nbsp;looks like archaeologists have recently dug this place out of&nbsp;the ground and left it&nbsp;here. But this is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;ancient city. The village was abandoned more than 200 years ago. But up&nbsp;to&nbsp;that point, this place had been thriving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/629/abf/4e9d115deeae65abb3722576d7.png><p>Kuldhara was a&nbsp;large village. Local people were mostly farmers. They sold their agricultural products. And then, one night, everything changed. People abandoned their homes and stuff and ran away from there. No&nbsp;one knows why they did&nbsp;it, and no&nbsp;one knows where they went. Nobody has ever seen the inhabitants of&nbsp;Kuldhara again.</p><p>Apart from tourists, almost no&nbsp;one comes here. The locals are sure that the village is&nbsp;cursed and is&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;paranormal activity. If&nbsp;you ask residents of&nbsp;other nearby towns or&nbsp;read the information on&nbsp;the Internet, you will learn a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;legends about this place. One popular version says that people left this village because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;water. However, this version doesn’t explain why the residents did it&nbsp;overnight and left their things behind.</p><p>According to&nbsp;another version, the villagers ran away to&nbsp;save the daughter of&nbsp;the Kuldhara chief. One local ruler fell in&nbsp;love with her and wanted to&nbsp;marry her. He&nbsp;threatened the locals with grave consequences if&nbsp;the girl rejected him. The ruler gave them one day to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;decision. The residents disagreed with such a&nbsp;requirement. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;solidarity, they decided to&nbsp;leave the village together with the chief and his daughter. But if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;true, why did no&nbsp;one else see these people? They must have escaped to&nbsp;another settlement. In&nbsp;addition, they needed their things on&nbsp;the way there. The stories of&nbsp;Kuldhara and Lake Anjikuni have one thing in&nbsp;common. People left a&nbsp;comfortable and safe place for an&nbsp;unknown reason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/422/fab/b346b053069d6fa9965a61d381.png><p>A&nbsp;similar story happened in&nbsp;Ireland with a&nbsp;small village on&nbsp;the island of&nbsp;Achill. About forty simple houses made of&nbsp;stone and straw were located along the valley of&nbsp;Keem Bay. The village was mentioned in&nbsp;documents dated back to&nbsp;the 1830s as&nbsp;a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;small buildings. But today, there’s practically nothing left of&nbsp;it&nbsp;except pieces of&nbsp;walls and small mounds of&nbsp;ground.</p><p>People from other settlements don’t remember this village. But we&nbsp;know about it&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;the records of&nbsp;travel writers. They described the incredible beauty of&nbsp;this place and the village in&nbsp;their diaries.Students of&nbsp;the local archaeological school tried to&nbsp;find the answers. They started excavations and discovered that the villagers could have left the village because of&nbsp;hunger or&nbsp;some disease.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYywn6iklWLDqrjLmp6eZZSewKK8z56Yq52UYsSqwMeorK1lpKeupLHSZquhnV2Wu6u1yq6lomWdrsC1sdGyZHFpZWV9dXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-whole-village-disappeared-without-traces-the-anjikuni-mystery-815004.html&text=The%20Whole%20Village%20Disappeared%20Without%20Traces%20%7c%7c%20The%20Anjikuni%20Mystery&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-whole-village-disappeared-without-traces-the-anjikuni-mystery-815004.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-whole-village-disappeared-without-traces-the-anjikuni-mystery-815004.html&title=The%20Whole%20Village%20Disappeared%20Without%20Traces%20%7c%7c%20The%20Anjikuni%20Mystery" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-whole-village-disappeared-without-traces-the-anjikuni-mystery-815004.html&title=The%20Whole%20Village%20Disappeared%20Without%20Traces%20%7c%7c%20The%20Anjikuni%20Mystery" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-whole-village-disappeared-without-traces-the-anjikuni-mystery-815004.html&title=The%20Whole%20Village%20Disappeared%20Without%20Traces%20%7c%7c%20The%20Anjikuni%20Mystery" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-whole-village-disappeared-without-traces-the-anjikuni-mystery-815004.html&description=The%20Whole%20Village%20Disappeared%20Without%20Traces%20%7c%7c%20The%20Anjikuni%20Mystery" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1591625-dis-tins-levels-reactions-wizkids-dj-tunez-hustles-beasts-tesla-giveaway.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="These Things Get Levels: Reactions as Wizkids DJ Tunez Hustles for Mr Beasts Tesla Givea">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1476942-snoop-dogg-lookalike-causes-chaos-nft-conference-new-york-city-fools-hundreds-fans-taking-selfies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Snoop Dogg Lookalike Causes Chaos at NFT Conference in New York City, Fools Hundreds of Fans Taking ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
