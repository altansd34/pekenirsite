He&nbsp;gets inspiration for his numerous posts from his charming daughters Lina and Amalia and his mischievous sons Adam and Asad. We&nbsp;can only envy the mother of&nbsp;this big <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, because not every father puts so&nbsp;many household chores and duties on&nbsp;their own shoulders. And he&nbsp;doesn’t consider it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;something special.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> kept getting surprised at&nbsp;how easily someone can cope with 4&nbsp;kids, while reading Mansur’s blog. Of&nbsp;course, they can’t do&nbsp;without funny situations (you’ll find the one we&nbsp;were laughing at&nbsp;the most at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article).</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;bad husband...</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b57/ab7/3194b45f6b928577d1a7b1b505.jpg><p>...and then&nbsp;I <a href=#>went</a> to&nbsp;the pharmacy and bought a&nbsp;pill called “Good husband.” I&nbsp;was taking it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning and in&nbsp;the evening and became perfect after a&nbsp;week.</p><p>You were waiting for this answer, right? But despite all the Vedic, psychological, and other different advice, I&nbsp;believe a&nbsp;man will keep changing if&nbsp;he&nbsp;realizes his mistakes.</p><p><br>My&nbsp;wife did not keep quiet when she felt bad, was annoyed, or&nbsp;was upset about my&nbsp;words and actions. I&nbsp;became more patient and calm. I&nbsp;didn’t want her to&nbsp;suffer, feel sad, or&nbsp;cry. I&nbsp;had 2&nbsp;growing daughters in&nbsp;my&nbsp;family and the thought that their husbands might offend or&nbsp;upset them was breaking my&nbsp;heart into pieces.</p><p><h2>How my&nbsp;wife finds time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything with 4&nbsp;little kids</h2></p><p>First of&nbsp;all, I&nbsp;<a href=#>help</a> her. Second, we&nbsp;have our older daughters who help&nbsp;us. Third, our house is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;various technical devices and appliances, like a&nbsp;washing machine, steam generator, and vacuum cleaners for dry and wet cleaning. Our kitchen is&nbsp;equipped with a&nbsp;dishwasher, a&nbsp;slow cooker, various blenders, and even a&nbsp;bread maker.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;don’t teach my&nbsp;kids that they should be&nbsp;like everyone else.</h2></p><p>Don’t <a href=#>follow</a> stereotypes. The times when everyone was living approximately the same life: kindergarten, school, college, and then work got left by&nbsp;the wayside a&nbsp;long time ago.</p><p>Another dangerous stereotype (but one that is&nbsp;relevant to&nbsp;the present time) is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the fact that we&nbsp;are afraid to&nbsp;let a&nbsp;kid take any responsibility. Today is&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;parents running after kids and doing everything for them. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, a&nbsp;kid can’t put on&nbsp;clothes by&nbsp;themselves at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;3, they can’t eat at&nbsp;4, they can’t brush their teeth at&nbsp;5, and they can’t even tie their shoelaces at&nbsp;7. And it’s not because something is&nbsp;wrong with them, but because they don’t feel the need to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;effort when their mother is&nbsp;always beside them to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for them.</p><p><h2>Why parents get divorced</h2></p><p>When I&nbsp;<a href=#>see the statistics</a> of&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorces data-link=tag>divorces</a>, my&nbsp;left eye starts to&nbsp;twitch. I&nbsp;have been pondering this for a&nbsp;long time, trying to&nbsp;understand why it&nbsp;happens, and&nbsp;I realized that many modern men are weak, while women are too strong.</p><p>No&nbsp;one will praise a&nbsp;mother and say, “OMG, you are walking around with your kid, that’s so&nbsp;sweet! Wow, you changed your kid’s diaper, you are such a&nbsp;good mother!” Then why do&nbsp;people say the same things to&nbsp;fathers? Bringing bacon to&nbsp;the family and helping the wife shouldn’t be&nbsp;perceived as&nbsp;something heroic that men&nbsp;do.</p><p><h2>How we&nbsp;manage to&nbsp;keep our kids away from gadgets</h2></p><p>Sometimes it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;<a href=#>take the tablet</a> away from your kid or&nbsp;to&nbsp;turn off the computer after the agreed upon time of&nbsp;using electronic devices is&nbsp;over.</p><p>Don’t use your strength&nbsp;— don’t take away or&nbsp;turn off the devices with force. This won’t work. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;much better to&nbsp;come up&nbsp;to&nbsp;your child, sit together with them for a&nbsp;bit, ask something about the character of&nbsp;the cartoon or&nbsp;the game they are involved&nbsp;in, and only after getting “into contact” ask the kid to&nbsp;switch off the gadget and do&nbsp;something else.</p><p><h2>There should be&nbsp;daily rituals in&nbsp;the family.</h2></p><p>Every morning our daughters <a href=#>brush their teeth</a>, comb their hair, change their pajamas for home dresses, and go&nbsp;downstairs for breakfast. This ritual repeats itself in&nbsp;the evening: brushing teeth, taking a&nbsp;shower, and changing home clothes for soft pajamas.</p><p>Right before they sleep, we&nbsp;scratch our kids’ backs, kiss them, say something nice to&nbsp;each of&nbsp;them, cover them with a&nbsp;blanket, and turn off the lights. While my&nbsp;wife is&nbsp;busy with her deals, I&nbsp;am the one who performs these rituals.</p><p><h2>Photos on&nbsp;Instagram and real life are 2&nbsp;different things.</h2></p><p>Yesterday, while my&nbsp;wife was <a href=#>setting</a> the table, our daughters Amalia and Lina decided to&nbsp;pretend they were shop assistants and made a&nbsp;pile of&nbsp;money, having cut up&nbsp;our electricity bill. Our older son, Asad, took out all the soil from a&nbsp;flower pot and was gladly jumping around in&nbsp;it. Our younger son, Adam, was singing really loudly while trying to&nbsp;get his fists and his feet into his mouth.</p><p>It&nbsp;was only morning&nbsp;— the start of&nbsp;the day. Things look quite different and nice in&nbsp;the photos on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>, don’t they?</p><p><h2>How to&nbsp;share household chores in&nbsp;the family</h2></p><p>Today we&nbsp;have been <a href=#>pondering</a> the question, “Who should cook food in&nbsp;the family?” My&nbsp;wife, for example, has a&nbsp;sister who doesn’t like to&nbsp;cook at&nbsp;all and it’s her husband who performs this task in&nbsp;their family. But my&nbsp;colleague doesn’t cook at&nbsp;all because he&nbsp;considers cooking a&nbsp;“woman’s thing.” But what should you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;the woman of&nbsp;the family works the same as&nbsp;her man does?</p><p>I&nbsp;think the right thing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;perform household chores equally, without dividing them into “things for men” and “things for women.” Each spouse should do&nbsp;things that:</p><ul><li>are more convenient for them (the husband takes the kids to&nbsp;school because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the way);</li><li>they can do&nbsp;better (a&nbsp;wife irons clothes better than husband);</li><li>they like to&nbsp;do (a&nbsp;husband hates washing the dishes, but likes cooking).</li></ul><p><h2>It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;more difficult with one kid than with 3&nbsp;or 4.</h2></p><p>Once we&nbsp;<a href=#>took</a> our older daughters to&nbsp;their grandparents for several days and only Asad, our youngest son at&nbsp;that moment, (Adam hadn’t been born yet) stayed with&nbsp;us. We&nbsp;were anticipating a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;calm days and careless walks with one baby in&nbsp;the stroller.</p><p>But we&nbsp;were wrong. When there were 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them, Asad was doing everything together with his sisters: he&nbsp;was eating with them and going to&nbsp;bed together with them too. It&nbsp;was noisy and messy, but structured. When he&nbsp;was alone, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;require constant attention from&nbsp;us and on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;would refuse to&nbsp;eat and sleep.</p><p>We&nbsp;got the girls back and our home became noisy again, but Asad stopped whining and started to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything with his sisters again. While we&nbsp;were still trying to&nbsp;restore our nervous system.</p><p><h2>Parents shouldn’t always skip out on&nbsp;the best things, for the sake of&nbsp;their kids.</h2></p><p>What is&nbsp;the right way to&nbsp;<a href=#>divide</a> a&nbsp;watermelon? Should parents give the sweetest central part, without seeds, to&nbsp;their kids and the rest to&nbsp;the adults? Or&nbsp;should everyone get equal pieces?</p><p>For many of&nbsp;today’s kids, it&nbsp;becomes a&nbsp;revelation that their parents might also have their own wants and dreams. And I&nbsp;am being serious. We&nbsp;give the best things to&nbsp;our kids. The kid’s interests are a&nbsp;priority. How about&nbsp;us&nbsp;— adults? We&nbsp;are also humans with our own emotions, wishes, plans, and dreams.</p><p>In&nbsp;our family, we&nbsp;split everything equally. We&nbsp;don’t deprive our kids of&nbsp;anything, it’s vice versa&nbsp;— we&nbsp;give them the priceless experience of&nbsp;living among people where everyone should take into account both their own interests and the needs of&nbsp;others.</p><p><h2>Should we&nbsp;try to&nbsp;curb the jealousy between our kids?</h2></p><p>2&nbsp;sisters <a href=#>look</a> at&nbsp;their brother. Is&nbsp;there a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;jealousy between them? Yes, it&nbsp;happens. I&nbsp;think that jealousy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal expression of&nbsp;feelings. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;control&nbsp;it.</p><p>Actually, those who have siblings are luckier to&nbsp;some extent&nbsp;— it’s good training for the future of&nbsp;adult life. Kids learn to&nbsp;communicate, stand up&nbsp;for their interests, find compromises, and listen to&nbsp;others in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big family.</p><p><h2>Don’t steal childhood from your kid.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b03/e30/9b67af545aa8aa300011613ceb.jpg><p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother’s <a href=#>love</a> and care basically lie in&nbsp;making sure that a&nbsp;baby eats well, that they’ve exercised, and that they sleep on&nbsp;time&nbsp;— when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the father, it’s important for him to&nbsp;have his own ambitions.</p><p>When Lina was born, I&nbsp;was 30&nbsp;years old. I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;teach her since the moment she started to&nbsp;say her first words. Lina turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;really talented kid and my&nbsp;parental ego was flourishing.</p><p>But looking at&nbsp;Amalia, who only knew a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;letters at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;3, I&nbsp;realize that we&nbsp;are giving her something that Lina was missing&nbsp;— a&nbsp;really carefree <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>. We&nbsp;don’t expect half of&nbsp;the things from Amalia that we&nbsp;were demanding from Lina at&nbsp;the same age. Sometimes it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that we&nbsp;have overdone it&nbsp;with her upbringing, trying to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;perfect kid with our older daughter.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;travel with the entire family.</h2></p><p><a href=#>Traveling with kids</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant hustling and bustling. They want to&nbsp;eat, drink, and pee every hour. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;constantly apologize for stomping on&nbsp;someone’s foot or&nbsp;for running into someone’s bag. We&nbsp;are always late, because it’s hard to&nbsp;collect all the kids who are running in&nbsp;different directions.</p><p>Eventually, you end up&nbsp;reaching your destination point with only one thought&nbsp;— to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;bed as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible, because you <a href=#>get as&nbsp;tired</a> as&nbsp;you would on&nbsp;the most hectic of&nbsp;your workdays.</p><p>But it’s so&nbsp;nice! It’s in&nbsp;these moments when you feel your life has a&nbsp;meaning. You have someone to&nbsp;show the beauty of&nbsp;this world to&nbsp;and convey your feelings to&nbsp;them. <a href=# title=Travel data-link=tag>Travel</a> with your family, guys. You’ll feel empty without your wife, sad without your kids, and lonely if&nbsp;you’re all alone.</p><p><h2>I&nbsp;am against pre-schools.</h2></p><p>They spend time teaching pre-schoolers one and a&nbsp;half hours at&nbsp;most, no&nbsp;more than that. And <a href=#>who says</a> that kids need 24/7&nbsp;entertainment? A&nbsp;child develops well, being involved in&nbsp;family processes like common cleaning, preparing dinner, walking, or&nbsp;watching a&nbsp;movie. None of&nbsp;the pre-school teachers will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;teach or&nbsp;replace these emotions.</p><p>I&nbsp;am not judging or&nbsp;criticizing anyone. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;family requires pre-school, it’s their choice. And, of&nbsp;course, each parent only wants the best for their kid.</p><p><h2>How to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid that they are loved</h2></p><p>Oftentimes, a&nbsp;kid might <a href=#>think</a> they are a&nbsp;burden, a&nbsp;punishment, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;unhappiness for their parents. Why does that happen? First, parents might think that the best way to&nbsp;express love is&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things that their kid needs (in&nbsp;their opinion). While an&nbsp;expression of&nbsp;love for a&nbsp;kid is&nbsp;doing something they want. Oftentimes, a&nbsp;kid wants to&nbsp;adopt a&nbsp;kitten, but parents buy another Barbie dollhouse. Or&nbsp;he&nbsp;might want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;fishing with his dad, but the parents take him to&nbsp;a&nbsp;museum on&nbsp;the weekend.</p><p>You need to&nbsp;tell your kids as&nbsp;often as&nbsp;possible that you love them, even if&nbsp;you think it’s obvious. Look in&nbsp;the eyes of&nbsp;your kid (on&nbsp;the kid’s level), use tactile contact, and say, “I&nbsp;love you, you are the best thing&nbsp;I have in&nbsp;life.” There can never be&nbsp;too many of&nbsp;these words.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Business meetings with tiaras and glitter</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39a/c37/84a67f53db8e7dabbb7996274a.jpg><p>Once I&nbsp;<a href=#>left</a> my&nbsp;house, late for an&nbsp;important meeting. Having already traveled half the way there, I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;I was still wearing slippers and a&nbsp;tiara on&nbsp;my&nbsp;head that my&nbsp;daughter Amalia presented me&nbsp;for my&nbsp;victory over a&nbsp;bloodthirsty dragon.</p><p>What did I&nbsp;do? I&nbsp;was extremely late, so&nbsp;I removed the tiara in&nbsp;the car and kept the footwear&nbsp;on. Much to&nbsp;my&nbsp;luck, I&nbsp;got to&nbsp;the restaurant where the meeting was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;held just a&nbsp;few minutes earlier than my&nbsp;colleagues and got a&nbsp;seat where&nbsp;I could hide my&nbsp;footwear.</p><p>But still, the people who came to&nbsp;the meeting were looking at&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;strange way. I&nbsp;asked what happened. My&nbsp;colleagues turned red and told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;look in&nbsp;the mirror.</p><p>In&nbsp;the restroom, I&nbsp;realized why they were so&nbsp;impressed. No, I&nbsp;didn’t have a&nbsp;tiara on&nbsp;my&nbsp;head, but my&nbsp;hair was covered with silver glitter. I&nbsp;took a&nbsp;deep breath and went back to&nbsp;my&nbsp;seat. I&nbsp;was no&nbsp;longer hiding my&nbsp;slippers&nbsp;— there was nothing more for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>The result?
