However, before the 19th century, this was unthinkable. What we&nbsp;now know as&nbsp;the bathroom <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>appeared</a> in&nbsp;Europe at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1800s when running water became widespread in&nbsp;the home. Previously, there were only public bathrooms, where it&nbsp;was common to&nbsp;play and even engage in&nbsp;conversation while performing intimate needs. We&nbsp;can’t imagine any of&nbsp;that in&nbsp;our time.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> researched some facts about ancient bathrooms and how they evolved from large gathering places to&nbsp;smaller, more personal venues.</p><p><h2>1. They were communal</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/26b/943/7480c35bd18e41acaa5a596529.jpg><p>From the Roman Empire to&nbsp;the Middle Ages, men and women washed in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>communal baths</a>. Built and run by&nbsp;the state, they were a&nbsp;common daily destination for bathing and socializing. These multi-purpose buildings concentrated cold, warm, and hot pools, but also stores, gymnasiums, and libraries. Some could accommodate up&nbsp;to&nbsp;1,600 people at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>2. They were not private at&nbsp;all</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82d/cbd/47521e5849872132391e75cbfa.jpg><p>Located in&nbsp;urban centers, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>latrines</a> were facilities that were usually designed next to&nbsp;the gardens in&nbsp;a&nbsp;city and they <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>housed</a> multiple people at&nbsp;the same time. What is&nbsp;now an&nbsp;extremely private moment, was not so&nbsp;private in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>1st century B.C.</a>, as&nbsp;the Romans saw it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;social activity.</p><p><h2>3. They were used to&nbsp;eat and to&nbsp;meet people</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c92/daf/2433a55834a7442d66c7a85d51.jpg><p>Some people like to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bathroom to&nbsp;chat or&nbsp;to&nbsp;fix a&nbsp;wardrobe detail. But the Romans ate, played, and brushed their teeth in&nbsp;these bathrooms. For them, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;perfectly normal habit and they didn’t mind doing their physical duties while hanging out with others.</p><p>In&nbsp;Roman times, baths were a&nbsp;great place to&nbsp;meet new people and socialize. According to&nbsp;one <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>study</a>, which investigated objects lost in&nbsp;the drains of&nbsp;these sites, bathers ate desserts, mussels, and shellfish there. They also enjoyed small cuts of&nbsp;beef, lamb, goat, pork, poultry, and wild deer.</p><p>They played with dice and coins and worked with textiles while in&nbsp;there. The latter, explains study researcher Alissa Whitmore, probably took place in&nbsp;the dressing rooms or&nbsp;common areas that had seating.</p><p><h2>4. They had a&nbsp;shared cleaning sponge</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/007/c25/32d6375cd98954695ebe791f04.jpg><p>Toilet paper did not yet exist in&nbsp;Ancient Rome, so&nbsp;they used a&nbsp;sea <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sponge</a> tied to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wooden stick to&nbsp;clean themselves. Perhaps most surprisingly, Roman public latrines had no&nbsp;private cubicles, so&nbsp;the sponge, after being used, was placed back in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bucket filled with salt water or&nbsp;vinegar. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;communal cleaning material.</p><p><h2>5. They were for the whole family</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/de3/00c/b2645f5efa9546756f50c6ad4f.jpg><p>From the Roman Empire to&nbsp;the Middle Ages, baths were mixed. In&nbsp;the latter period, it&nbsp;was customary to&nbsp;take them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>. The preparation for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>bathing</a> started at&nbsp;home. It&nbsp;was common to&nbsp;see the father of&nbsp;the family, or&nbsp;the child, walking down the street in&nbsp;their underwear.</p><p><h2>6. They were outdoors</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f0/bed/f94feb5623a5dbbd18258178f2.jpg><p>During the Middle Ages, if&nbsp;you wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the bathroom, all you had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was find a&nbsp;stairway, bridge, or&nbsp;other public places. During this period, the street served to&nbsp;satisfy one’s natural needs.</p><p>Historian Carole Rawcliffe <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>explains</a> that in&nbsp;the late Middle Ages, people became more interested in&nbsp;<a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> and hygiene. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, authorities funded public latrines to&nbsp;keep their cities clean. Large facilities arose where people, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>mostly</a> men, could relieve themselves through holes inserted in&nbsp;bridges that deposited human waste in&nbsp;the rivers that flowed under them.</p><p><h2>7. The latrines smelled very bad, especially in&nbsp;the summer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/001/dfd/4f54425f99ad3a6ffccda60e7f.jpg><p>During this same period, the design of&nbsp;the bathrooms was based on&nbsp;social class. Castles were <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>equipped</a> with special spaces that had holes in&nbsp;the floor. They were similar to&nbsp;closets, inserted into the thickness of&nbsp;the outer walls, and dumped human waste into pits on&nbsp;the first floors.</p><p>The latrines sent the excrement directly into the cellars or&nbsp;the castle moat. The smell produced by&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>cesspit</a> was unbearable, especially in&nbsp;summer, because it&nbsp;rose through the pipes and returned through the mouth of&nbsp;the latrine.</p><p><h2>8. They had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;emptied manually</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96d/505/25a15053b1ba5783b3d4208275.jpg><p>The use of&nbsp;the toilet was gradually adopted by&nbsp;the society of&nbsp;the 18th century, so&nbsp;that even in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;this century the use of&nbsp;latrines was common, the contents of&nbsp;which were <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>emptied</a> by&nbsp;“nightmen.” They were in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;collecting waste when the streets were empty.</p><p>The service of&nbsp;the nightmen was provided every 24&nbsp;hours in&nbsp;the best districts. Although it&nbsp;was less frequent in&nbsp;the poorer areas.</p><p><h2>9. Waste was dumped in&nbsp;the streets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/069/252/7c65d151f9bf9eca2f76e0f1c4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;ancient times, access to&nbsp;waste management was a&nbsp;class privilege. Thus, in&nbsp;the absence of&nbsp;an&nbsp;indoor toilet, people in&nbsp;Edinburgh used to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>shout</a> “Gardyloo!” to&nbsp;warn passersby of&nbsp;the human waste they were about to&nbsp;throw from their window.</p><p>This term came from the French expression, “<i>Prenez garde a&nbsp;l’eau!</i>”&nbsp;— meaning literally “beware of&nbsp;the water.” This practice continued until the introduction of&nbsp;sewage systems in&nbsp;the 19th century.</p><p><h2>10. They were a&nbsp;focus of&nbsp;infections</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b19/7d5/fa58665410a4f66927ff9fa3d0.jpg><p>After the first sewage systems were installed in&nbsp;European cities, deaths from cholera and typhoid fever decreased exponentially. It&nbsp;turns out that the first of&nbsp;these diseases were <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>spread</a> through contaminated water. Today, this may seem obvious, but it&nbsp;took researchers years to&nbsp;figure this out.</p><p>The first to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;was Dr. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>John Snow</a>, who, through the use of&nbsp;maps, identified the source of&nbsp;the infection in&nbsp;London: a&nbsp;septic tank under one of&nbsp;the nearby houses was leaking into the well that supplied the water pump. Snow’s work was not only a&nbsp;milestone in&nbsp;sanitary mapping and the first epidemiological work in&nbsp;<a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a> but also the starting point for the modern sanitation systems later adopted by&nbsp;Western cities.</p><p>Have you ever had to&nbsp;look for or&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;bathroom other than the one in&nbsp;your home?
