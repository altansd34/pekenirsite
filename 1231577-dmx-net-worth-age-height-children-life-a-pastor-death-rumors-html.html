He became one of the most successful rappers of our time, a multi-platinum artist, who managed to raise the neglected Def Jam to the top of hip-hop games. A lot of people compared him to 2Pac for the sincerity of the texts.</p><h2>DMX net worth, short bio and career</h2><p class=align-left>Earl Simmons or as many of us know him as Dark Man X, or simply DMX was born in Baltimore on the 18th of December in 1970. The American rapper and actor achieved his world fame in the late 90s. Five of his albums, starting with the first one, It’s Dark and Hell is Hot, debuted on the top of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Billboard 200 charts</a> in a row, which is an unprecedented case.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lil Baby net worth: how has the rapper earned all his riches?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The rapper's childhood was very troublesome. Five sisters and a single mother were all that he saw around. Since being a young boy, problems with the law overtook him. The poor health of the child and the constant lack of finances forced the woman to send the child to boarding school. The lousy company had a negative impact on the impressionable boy.</p><p class=align-left>Quite early, the teenager was in a colony for hooliganism, robbery and vandalism. After his release, Earl, in his own words, decided to take up music in order to attract the attention of girls more.</p><p class=align-left>Today Earl Simmons age is 48. For his life, the talented performer was sentenced to jail more than 15 times but never ceased to violate the law. The charges were very different – from animal abuse to falsification of documents and drug use.</p><p class=align-left>They say that the cause of such rash behaviour was a psychological illness. He has been diagnosed with bipolar personality disorder, so he is emotionally unstable. The rapper himself denies his own problems and once again turns to lawyers for help in order to avoid a new criminal prosecution.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/199e19175f0389ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The tragedy and incredible life of Daniel Johnston</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apart from a musician's career, this man has also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">succeeded as an actor</a>.

The police found him without breathing and no pulse. Doctors suspected a drug оverdose, as indicated by several symptoms. However, relatives of the musician did not agree with this statement.</p><p class=align-left>Later, the conscious rapper confirmed that he did not take any banned substances. He noted that he did not remember anything, except for sudden onset of dyspnea, which, he said, was the result of recently suffered bronchitis. Fortunately, the state of the musician improved soon.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8b7dde88d805c248.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything about famous Master P net worth, career, and personal life!</span></p></a><h3>DMX children and wife</h3><p class=align-left>American rapper met his future wife long before the start of his musical career, being a young man. Earl and Tashera grew up in the neighbouring streets. When the future wife of the rapper was 11 years old, the girl saw how DMX robbed an old woman. From that moment, Tashera made a decision to become a true girlfriend of young Simmons.</p><p class=align-left>In 1999, the lovers got married. For 11 years of life as a couple, they had four children. Their names are Xavier, Shawn, Tocoma and Praise Mary Ella. The marriage of the musician ended in 2010 because some of the children are not really from the wife.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Robert De Niro first wife Diahnne Abbott bio: top 10 facts about the actress</p><p class=align-left>In 2016, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DMX and Desiree Lindstrom</a>, his new girlfriend gave birth to a son, whom the couple called Exodus.

Nevertheless, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Earl Simmons is a Christian</a> and reads the Bible every day according to his words. He was a priest in 2009-2012 and later received the opportunity to become a pastor.</p><h3>What is DMX net worth?</h3><p class=align-left>Another interesting fact about restless rapper is DMX net worth. For the present day, it is as much as minus 10 million US dollars. Yes, you have heard right. Such a situation is a fact of life for DMX providing all his children from different women and legal problems.</p><p class=align-left>DMX net worth in his prime must have been pretty big taking into account the fact that his movies have earned about 300 million US dollars. .</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1812fee714a14475.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exciting facts about Ja Rule's net worth and life</span></p></a><p></p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Switched at Birth Katie Leclerc: age, husband, is she actually deaf?</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN%2FkG5ucGWUosVuusStZLCnoqm1bq3GnmShnZmctbV5wqGgpZyimrtuuMifnGaZXaWutMDOq2SdnZGptW6%2B1Kamq6tencGuuA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f1231577-dmx-net-worth-age-height-children-life-a-pastor-death-rumors-html.html&text=DMX%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20children%2c%20life%20as%20a%20pastor%2c%20death%20rumors&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1231577-dmx-net-worth-age-height-children-life-a-pastor-death-rumors-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1231577-dmx-net-worth-age-height-children-life-a-pastor-death-rumors-html.html&title=DMX%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20children%2c%20life%20as%20a%20pastor%2c%20death%20rumors" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f1231577-dmx-net-worth-age-height-children-life-a-pastor-death-rumors-html.html&title=DMX%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20children%2c%20life%20as%20a%20pastor%2c%20death%20rumors" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f1231577-dmx-net-worth-age-height-children-life-a-pastor-death-rumors-html.html&title=DMX%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20children%2c%20life%20as%20a%20pastor%2c%20death%20rumors" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1231577-dmx-net-worth-age-height-children-life-a-pastor-death-rumors-html.html&description=DMX%20net%20worth%2c%20age%2c%20height%2c%20children%2c%20life%20as%20a%20pastor%2c%20death%20rumors" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elon-musk-favorability.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elon Musk Loses Luster With the Left Amid His GOP Flirtations">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1432249-cool-pet-tortoise-turtle-names-shelly-friend-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cool pet tortoise and turtle names for your shelly best friend">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
