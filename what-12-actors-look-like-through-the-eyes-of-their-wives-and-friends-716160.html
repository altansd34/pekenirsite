Many of&nbsp;them become the focus of&nbsp;both men and women’s dreams for many years. But more often than not, their image on&nbsp;the big screen has very little to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the actual personalities of&nbsp;these actors.</p><p><h2>1. Jason Momoa</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a89/a67/81d324535f92a17981f10477fd.jpg><p>The American actor with Hawaiian origin, <a href=# title="Jason Momoa" data-link=tag>Jason Momoa</a>, is&nbsp;often seen in&nbsp;movies as&nbsp;a&nbsp;man with a&nbsp;scary look and a&nbsp;stern face. Everyone knows him from his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful warrior on&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones and as&nbsp;the main character in&nbsp;Aquaman.</p><p>But in&nbsp;real life, Jason Momoa is&nbsp;completely opposite of&nbsp;what he&nbsp;appears to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on-screen. This super tall guy always smiles because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;constantly in&nbsp;a&nbsp;great mood. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family man who loves his wife and children. And his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> posts will definitely make anyone feel good. This is&nbsp;why his colleagues adore him.</p><p><h2>2. Jamie Dornan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7da/b60/442a575a31a44700f1d3cad791.jpg><p>Women know Irish actor Jamie Dornan from his role in&nbsp;Fifty Shades of&nbsp;Grey. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the very few people who doesn’t use <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> and tries to&nbsp;hide his private life from other people. Jamie explains his attitude like this: the more open a&nbsp;person&nbsp;is, the more active <a href=#>haters</a> are.</p><p>Aside from his acting career, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;very successful in&nbsp;the modeling business: Jamie often appears in&nbsp;commercials for companies like <a href=#>Hugo Boss, Dior, and Calvin Klein</a>. But his favorite ways to&nbsp;spend his free time is&nbsp;by&nbsp;being with his children and playing golf. He&nbsp;says that the most fun for him is&nbsp;just being a&nbsp;parent. Currently, he&nbsp;and his wife are expecting another child.</p><p><h2>3. Tom Hardy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a29/634/c22b7d5883a7e862c5b176e7e7.jpg><p><a href=# title="Tom Hardy" data-link=tag>Tom Hardy</a> looks like the guy who is&nbsp;always on&nbsp;the edge, constantly in&nbsp;danger and in&nbsp;trouble. But Tom has changed dramatically since the moment he&nbsp;started a&nbsp;family. And now you can see him in&nbsp;his usual image only on-screen.</p><p>It’s also well known that Tom is&nbsp;good friends with <a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. They constantly make <a href=#>ridiculous bets </a>and get into funny situations. If&nbsp;you add in&nbsp;his love for dogs and bikes, you get a&nbsp;perfect image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind guy.</p><p><h2>4. Jude Law</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/25f/fc2/7826f7583f8d89a7b1dd739c44.jpg><p>The role of&nbsp;the Pope in&nbsp;The Young Pope only highlights the charm and attractiveness of&nbsp;English actor Jude Law. Now, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;46&nbsp;years old and he&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;impress women every time he&nbsp;appears on&nbsp;the movie screen, any tv-series, or&nbsp;theater show.</p><p>In&nbsp;real life, Jude is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very popular man. Even though he&nbsp;has <a href=#>5&nbsp;children from different women</a>, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;bachelor and he&nbsp;spends all his time working. Jude has a&nbsp;lot in&nbsp;common with the characters he&nbsp;portrays. He&nbsp;dresses in&nbsp;trendy clothes and regularly breaks women’s hearts, disappearing from women’s lives.</p><p><h2>5. Jake Gyllenhaal</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e31/3cb/86e67758b6aad21810b6a2727a.jpg><p>Despite the fact Jake has been called the most handsome man on&nbsp;the planet, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;bachelor, probably the most attractive among the Hollywood stars. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>42&nbsp;years old,</a> he&nbsp;has never been married, and he&nbsp;doesn’t have any children. But he&nbsp;is&nbsp;the godfather of&nbsp;Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams’ child.</p><p>A&nbsp;short time ago, he&nbsp;did a&nbsp;<a href=#>Calvin Klein</a> commercial where he&nbsp;played the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;great father who looked at&nbsp;his little daughter and hugged his beautiful wife. Obviously, he&nbsp;looked great in&nbsp;this role but we&nbsp;have no&nbsp;idea why Jake still hasn’t managed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;woman he&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;marry.</p><p><h2>6. Tom Hiddleston</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/41e/0d9/4302875345a206491cf1fb24e4.jpg><p>Tom Hiddleston looks and behaves in&nbsp;such an&nbsp;aristocratic manner on&nbsp;the screen that he&nbsp;has been called the sexiest man in&nbsp;the movie industry several times. Years ago, his relationship with the famous <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> ended and since then, he&nbsp;has been doing a&nbsp;great job hiding information about his personal life.</p><p>He&nbsp;considers himself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loyal feminist and he&nbsp;spends a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;his time on&nbsp;<a href=#>charity</a>. His love for children makes him devote a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time to&nbsp;helping others. In&nbsp;his life, Tom is&nbsp;also known as&nbsp;an&nbsp;intelligent man with a&nbsp;great sense of&nbsp;humor. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;great dancer.</p><p><h2>7. James Franco</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f39/592/35ddc55bcf999a997baac657b9.jpg><p>We&nbsp;are used to&nbsp;seeing James Franco on-screen but he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;other talents that he&nbsp;doesn’t talk a&nbsp;lot about. For example, James writes <a href=#>essays and articles</a> for different magazines, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;seriously into <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a>. Also, he&nbsp;often gives lectures about films and acting, most of&nbsp;which are free.</p><p>James really loves the internet and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;famous for his online communication with his female fans. His online flirting has been the reason for many scandals in&nbsp;the actor’s life. Aside from that, James also loves taking <a href=#>selfies</a>&nbsp;— most of&nbsp;them are very provocative but this hobby was not received well by&nbsp;the public so&nbsp;the actor had to&nbsp;delete his accounts from social media.</p><p><h2>8. Chris Hemsworth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb4/7a2/9274ce5e66a41bb3c478571a92.jpg><p>It’s really hard to&nbsp;imagine a&nbsp;Marvel blockbuster without Chris Hemsworth. However, in&nbsp;real life, Chris is&nbsp;nothing like the single superhero who saves the universe. The actor is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> to&nbsp;the beautiful Elsa Pataky, and they have 3&nbsp;children together.</p><p>Chris is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;fitness and living a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle. This hobby comes in&nbsp;handy in&nbsp;his line of&nbsp;work because the roles of&nbsp;superheroes he&nbsp;plays require great physical preparation. When he&nbsp;has free time, the actor develops his own smartphone <a href=#>app</a> that will help users live a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle and play sports effectively.</p><p><h2>9. Kit Harington</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9d/800/92fbc75c99ae7f29e52b8c682c.jpg><p>Very soon, we&nbsp;will see one of&nbsp;the main Game of&nbsp;Thrones characters, Jon Snow, portrayed by&nbsp;Kit Harington. The actor hasn’t starred in&nbsp;many movies yet because he&nbsp;started his career only in&nbsp;<a href=#>2011</a>. But he&nbsp;is&nbsp;making great progress.</p><p>The actor was born in&nbsp;an&nbsp;aristocratic family so&nbsp;he&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;live by&nbsp;original British traditions. For example, he&nbsp;lives in&nbsp;a&nbsp;15th-century mansion and he&nbsp;celebrated his wedding in&nbsp;a&nbsp;12th-century castle. He&nbsp;also loves football and does a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;charity work. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge part of&nbsp;Kit’s life.</p><p><h2>10. Leonardo DiCaprio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/008/017/cc91c052aa9ccc7aa79ff8b707.jpg><p>It’s impossible to&nbsp;imagine the film industry without Leonardo DiCaprio. Despite the fact that he’s been acting since 1989, he&nbsp;still can’t get used to&nbsp;all the attention from his fans and the paparazzi. You will never see the actor without camouflage in&nbsp;the street: he&nbsp;always covers his face with glasses, a&nbsp;baseball cap, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;hood.</p><p>Leo may try to&nbsp;fix his personal life, but he&nbsp;doesn’t have a&nbsp;serious relationship even though he&nbsp;is&nbsp;already 44&nbsp;years old. Leonardo is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;use his popularity for a&nbsp;good cause. He&nbsp;takes part in&nbsp;different charity projects to&nbsp;attract attention to&nbsp;<a href=#>ecological problems</a>. Even when he&nbsp;received his long-awaited Oscar, Leo drew attention to&nbsp;environmental issues rather than himself.</p><p><h2>11. Ryan Gosling</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ca/01e/bddd0f5dc389699f9ad13bbb92.jpg><p>We&nbsp;will never forget the amazing role Ryan Gosling played in&nbsp;The Notebook. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;romantic man who loved only one woman in&nbsp;that movie. After the film, Ryan couldn’t shake off that image but everything changed after he&nbsp;met his true love, <a href=#>Eva Mendes</a>. We&nbsp;learned that Ryan is&nbsp;a&nbsp;caring father and a&nbsp;loving husband and his roles have become way more serious since then.</p><p>After they had children, both actors slowed down the pace of&nbsp;their lives, and hide their children and their lives from other people. Just like many other guys in&nbsp;Hollywood, Ryan does charity work and is&nbsp;developing his own business, a&nbsp;<a href=#>restaurant</a>.</p><p><h2>12. Bradley Cooper</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/961/39c/0f49255ad383d9995f573f0700.jpg><p>After his epic Grammy performance, Bradley Cooper is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer just a&nbsp;nice actor. Now we&nbsp;know he’s also a&nbsp;talented musician, singer, and director. Bradley always smiles on-screen and this is&nbsp;probably the only thing that is&nbsp;similar between Bradley and his characters. His <a href=#>colleagues</a> said that in&nbsp;real life, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;confident.</p><p>Even though Bradley Cooper is&nbsp;not married officially, the entire world knows that he&nbsp;found his love&nbsp;— Irina Shayk. The couple even has a&nbsp;daughter together. Bradley is&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;father and now he&nbsp;has something more important in&nbsp;his life than his job.</p><p><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s gift of&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendship ring to&nbsp;Kate Winslet has sparked intrigue among fans. While the two actors have shared undeniable on-screen chemistry since their “Titanic” days, Winslet has clarified that their relationship has always been platonic. The ring, a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;their enduring friendship, contains a&nbsp;secret engraving, which Winslet playfully keeps private. Their genuine camaraderie continues to&nbsp;inspire and captivate audiences worldwide.</p><p><b>Please note</b>: This article was updated in April 2023 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmaGtlkZjBsL7SZqOop5tiuaq3xGaroaqfqrSpedOhnGadqZrAbrvFZquhnZmneri11Z6qZpmemXqnvsiepZ2rXWx%2Bd32VaWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-12-actors-look-like-through-the-eyes-of-their-wives-and-friends-716160.html&text=What%2012%20Actors%20Look%20Like%20Through%20the%20Eyes%20of%20Their%20Wives%20and%20Friends&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-12-actors-look-like-through-the-eyes-of-their-wives-and-friends-716160.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-12-actors-look-like-through-the-eyes-of-their-wives-and-friends-716160.html&title=What%2012%20Actors%20Look%20Like%20Through%20the%20Eyes%20of%20Their%20Wives%20and%20Friends" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-12-actors-look-like-through-the-eyes-of-their-wives-and-friends-716160.html&title=What%2012%20Actors%20Look%20Like%20Through%20the%20Eyes%20of%20Their%20Wives%20and%20Friends" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-12-actors-look-like-through-the-eyes-of-their-wives-and-friends-716160.html&title=What%2012%20Actors%20Look%20Like%20Through%20the%20Eyes%20of%20Their%20Wives%20and%20Friends" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-12-actors-look-like-through-the-eyes-of-their-wives-and-friends-716160.html&description=What%2012%20Actors%20Look%20Like%20Through%20the%20Eyes%20of%20Their%20Wives%20and%20Friends" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-will-earth-look-like-in-1000-years-395310.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Will Earth Look Like in1,000Years?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1537263-wayans-siblings-members-legendary-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wayans siblings: who are the members of the legendary family?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
